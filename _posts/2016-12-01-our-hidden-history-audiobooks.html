<p>The Church Committee, officially known as the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, was a committee charged with investigating abuses by the CIA, FBI, NSA and IRS. We've chosen 24 different sections of the reports, which open the lid on everything from alleged assassination plots that the US government carried out against several foreign leaders, to the FBI's war on Black leaders, to the FBI and CIA's performance during the assassination of President Kennedy. Truly eye-opening material.</p>

House Select Committee on Assassinations<br>
Oswald, the CIA, and Mexico City (aka The Lopez Report)<br>
Written by Dan Hardway and Edwin Lopez<br><br>
The Warren Commission's tried to offer easy answers the complicated CIA story about Lee Harvey Oswald and Mexico City. This 1978 report, written by two of the most tenacious investigators on the HSCA, took a deeper look at the CIA's claims. Was Lee Oswald impersonated in Mexico City? Why couldn't the CIA, with all of their surveillance of the sites Oswald visited, come up with any photos or a voice recording of him there? Dan Hardway and Ed Lopez attempt to answer these questions and many more in this report.</p>

In 1975, The US Senate's "Church Committee" (named after its head, Senator Frank Church) led a series of investigations into the abuses by US government agencies such as the FBI, CIA, NSA, IRS and others. <br><br>
Part of the committee's investigation examined the Federal Bureau of Investigation's "war" against Civil Rights Leader Martin Luther King, Jr. That investigation produced a case study detailing the dangerous and often unconstitutional actions that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI took against Dr. King. This audiobook contains that case study.</p>
