Veteran researcher and author Christopher Simpson discusses his book The Splendid Blond Beast: Money, Law and Genocide in the 20th Century (soft-cover edition, Common Courage Press, copyright 1995). The program begins with discussion of the Turkish genocide against the Armenians during World War I and proceeds to the subject of the international financial situation at the end of that war. After analyzing the re-capitalization of Germany by American financial institutions in the 1920s, Simpson discusses the viewpoint held within the U.S. State Department and the British Foreign Office that Nazi Germany would make a useful bulwark against the Soviet Union. The program sets forth the role of people like Allen and John Foster Dulles (of the powerful Wall Street law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell) in financing the fascist powers of Europe and deflecting investigations of war crimes after World War II. The Dulles brothers and fellow members of the American elite, such as former U.S. diplomat George Kennan, saw the prosecution of Nazi war criminals as being against U.S. interests as the Cold War began.
