July 23, 2005 | Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed talked about his book The War on Truth: 9/11, Disinformation, and the Anatomy of Terrorism, published by Olive Branch Press. In the book he outlines the relationship between the West and radical Muslim groups such as the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in Algeria, and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in Serbia. Mr. Ahmed says that these groups, parts of which are now affiliated with Al Qaeda, were used by the United States and Britain to further Western political and economic goals. He argues that a more complete investigation of this relationship is necessary to understand what happened on 9/11. Mr. Ahmed also talks about the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1996 British attempt to assassinate Libyaâ€™s Muammar Gaddafi in this light. After his presentation he responded to questions from members of the audience. This talk, held at American University in Washington, D.C., was part of an event organized by the D.C. Emergency Truth Convergence.
