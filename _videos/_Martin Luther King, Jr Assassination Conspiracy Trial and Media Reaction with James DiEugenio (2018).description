James DiEugenio is the editor and publisher of kennedysandking.com and he's the author of 'JFK: The Evidence Today'. He's also a noted researcher of the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination and that's what we're going to talk about today. People are aware there was a civil trial in 1999 led by the King family in which the jury found that the assassination was a result of a conspiracy. 

I've been wanting to talk about this case for a long time so I found an article that Jim wrote at the time about the media's reaction to the trial's outcome.

It's sort of a timeless subject to see how the press deals with events that run counter to their narratives, and Jim is always brilliant at dissecting the tropes that the media uses to kind of get around things that run counter to what they want to say.
