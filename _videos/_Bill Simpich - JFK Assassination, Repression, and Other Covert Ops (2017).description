Bill Simpich is an attorney, anti-war activist, and author. We discussed the JFK assassination, CIA/Contra drug smuggling, COINTELPRO, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.

 Bill has been practicing law 35 years now. He's worked on several important political cases. He's been in court against both the FBI and the CIA - against the FBI in a case where two political activists were the victims of a car bombing, and against the CIA for their involvement Contra drug trafficking. A case against the Bush Administration for their civil liberties clampdown during the 'War on Terror'. He's worked on cases of police shootings in the Bay Area. And most recently, I think, a case to make sure votes were counted properly in the California Democratic Primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

He's also written on political assassinations during the 1960s such as the murders of Black Panther leaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, CIA attempts on the life of Fidel Castro, and on the assassination of John Kennedy, about which he's written a book 'State Secret' and a series of articles entitled 'The Twelve Who Built the Oswald Legend'.

This interview covers all of these topics and more, and tries to find the common themes between them all.
