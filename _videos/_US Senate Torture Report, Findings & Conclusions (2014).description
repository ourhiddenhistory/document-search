This is a reading of The United States Senate Intelligence Committee's 'Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program (Findings and Conclusions)' otherwise known as the US Senate "Torture Report". The report is the results of an investigation into the use of torture (called "enhanced interrogation techniques" by the CIA, Bush Administration and Senate Investigators) on detainees captured around the globe during the Bush Administration's "War on Terror" between 2001 and 2006.

From Wikipedia: "The 6,000-page report details actions by CIA officials and findings of the study of the Detention and Interrogation Program. On December 9, 2014—eight months after voting to release parts of the report—the SSCI released a 525-page portion that consisted of key findings and an executive summary of the full report. It took five years and $40 million to compile the report. The rest of it remains classified. 

The report details actions by CIA officials, including torturing prisoners, providing misleading or false information about classified CIA programs to the media, impeding government oversight and internal criticism, and mismanaging of the program. It also revealed the existence of previously unknown detainees, that more detainees were subjected to harsher treatment than was previously disclosed, and that more forms of torture were used than previously disclosed. It concluded that torturing prisoners did not help acquire actionable intelligence or gain cooperation from detainees and that the program damaged the United States' international standing."
