Hugh Sloan

Hugh W. Sloan Jr. (born November 1, 1940) was treasurer of the Committee to Re-elect the President, Richard M. Nixon's 1972 campaign committee. Previously, he was an aide to White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman.

He resigned from the Committee to Re-elect over ethics concerns related to actions behind the Watergate scandal. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, in their book All the President's Men, portrayed Sloan as one of the few honest men they interviewed.

Maurice Stans

Maurice Hubert Stans (March 22, 1908 â€“ April 14, 1998) was an American accountant, high-ranking civil servant, Cabinet member, and political organizer. He served as the finance chairman for the Committee to Re-elect the President, working for the re-election of Richard Nixon. While a peripheral figure in the ensuing Watergate Scandal, he was convicted on multiple counts under the Federal Election Campaign Act that were revealed during the larger investigation into Watergate.
