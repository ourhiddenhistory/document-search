The program reviews and and analyzes the international controversy surrounding former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Installed in a CIA-supported coup in 1973, Pinochet was detained in London in late 1998 on an extradition request from a Spanish court. The broadcast sets forth some of the aspects of international law and war-crime guilt as discussed in Simpson’s landmark book, The Splendid Blond Beast: Money, Law and Genocide in the 20th Century (Soft-cover edition, Common Courage Press, copyright 1995). The discussion also centers on Operation Sunrise, the arranged surrender of al SS forces in Italy at the conclusion of World War II. Arranged by OSS officer and Wall Street lawyer Allen Dulles (who later became director of the CIA), Operation Sunrise was a breach of the accord between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies. One of the key SS officers who negotiated with Dulles was Walther Rauff, a heinous war criminal, who later made his way to Chile and, according to Amnesty International, became an advisor to Pinochet’s government and helped direct its prison system.
