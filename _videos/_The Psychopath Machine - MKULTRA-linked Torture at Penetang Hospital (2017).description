Mr. Steve Smith is the author of the book 'The Psychopath Machine' (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JKJ1OWE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). I'm very glad to have him here to tell his story. In 1968, when he was just a teenager, Steve found himself pulled into the justice system in Canada, and as happens all too often, I think the system sort of took over and Steve, though he was brought in for a very minor crime, eventually ended up in Penetanguishene Mental Hospital, Oak Ridge Division. There he was subjected to a really bizarre series of "treatments" I guess you might call it, but a Canadian judge has recently ruled that that was more rightly called torture.

I first heard about Steve in a radio interview he did in 2001, and a couple months ago I ran across some articles in Canada's Globe and Mail that a judge had made a ruling due to a class action lawsuit from several patients (http://oakridgeclassaction.ca/) that were at this facility that what happened there was indeed torture. This is a few paragraphs from the Globe and Mail, June 7, 2017 (https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/doctors-at-ontario-mental-health-facility-tortured-patients-court-finds/article35246519/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&):

"Patients at a maximum security mental health facility in Ontario were tortured by medical doctors over a 17 year period in unethical and degrading human experiments a judge has ruled in a lawsuit. Techniques used on the patients between 1966 and 1983 included solitary confinement as treatment and as punishment, administration of hallucinogens and delirium producing drugs, including LSD, and brainwashing methods developed by the CIA according to Justice Paul Perrell of Ontario Superior Court of Justice."

"Some of the patients at Oak Ridge division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health Center in central Ontario had been charged with crimes such as rape, murder and child abuse and been found not guilty by reason of insanity. Others had simply been committed by their doctors. Oak Ridge doctors contended that with intensive therapy the patients could some day be freed. An estimated 1,260 patients spent time in the program between 1965 and 1979."
