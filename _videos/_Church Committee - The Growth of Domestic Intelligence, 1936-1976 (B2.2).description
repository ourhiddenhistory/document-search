More Church Committee Reports: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBINnEpNu5u5DDKZr3zRDb9v_Q2pV55dA ---- This is an audio recording of the second section of the second book of the Church Committee's Final Report -- "INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND THE RIGHTS OF AMERICANS, THE GROWTH OF DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE 1936 TO 1976" (B2.1). The Church Committee, officially known as the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, was a committee charged with investigating abuses by the intelligence agencies of the United States.

From the AARC Website: "Book II moves from foreign and military intelligence to domestic intelligence. The report is concerned primarily with the FBI's COINTELPRO counter-intelligence campaign, but also discusses the CIA's Operation CHAOS, whereby the CIA engaged in domestic intelligence work in violation of the CIA charter. Other agencies including the NSA and Army Intelligence are also discussed. Illegal electronic surveillance, mail opening, infiltration of dissident groups, "black bag" break-in jobs, media manipulation, IRS targeting, and the intense campaign waged against Martin Luther King, Jr. are all subjects of this report. The overriding theme is the violation of the rights of Americans as identified in the U.S. Constitution."
