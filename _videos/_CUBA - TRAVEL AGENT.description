A former C-I-A agent has begun what he says is the first independent American business in Cuba for 40 years.

Former agent Philip Agee has teamed up with European investors and the state-run travel agent to open a travel Web site designed specifically to bring American tourists to the island - even if it means violating the U-S trade embargo.

Agee is a longtime friend of Cuba and the writer of a tell all book on the C-I-A's actions in Latin America in the 1960s.

The site, cubalinda.com, offers package tours within Cuba and other help with Cuban tourism that is largely off limits to Americans because of U-S law.

Agee has long enraged supporters of U-S sanctions on Cuba by his support of Fidel Castro's revolution and campaign to end the nearly four-decade-old embargo which limits American tourists from spending money on the island - effectively barring them from visiting.

He has also been accused of receiving up to 1 (m) million U-S dollars in payments from the Cuban intelligence service.

He has denied the accusations.

Agee quit the C-I-A in 1969 after 12 years with the agency.

He worked mostly in Latin America during the years that leftist movements were gaining prominence and sympathizers.

His 1975 book "Inside the Company: CIA Diary" cited alleged C-I-A misdeeds against leftists in Latin America that included a 22-page list of purported agency operatives.

At a press conference in Havana, Agee again spoke out against the U-S embargo.

 SOUNDBITE (English): 
"I established this business over the last three years in order to promote travel to Cuba, and especially travel to Cuba by Americans. I believe that Cuba has a lot to offer people in the United States, and I think it's long since that this trade embargo should be ended."

Agee's U-S passport was revoked in 1979. 

U-S officials said he had threatened national security.

After years of living in Hamburg, Germany - occasionally underground, fearing C-I-A retribution - Agee has decided to make Havana his home and the seat of his new business.

SOUNDBITE: (English)
"In my particular case, I have no license, I have not asked for a license, and I'm not going to ask for a license because, as a matter of principle, I do not submit to the element of control that the fanatics in Miami exercise over US policy toward Cuba. I felt three years ago that the time had come for this project, and we are promoting travel and tourism in Cuba through the internet."

American companies have been barred from doing business with Cuba since the embargo was imposed in the 1960s to put pressure on Castro.

SOUNDBITE: (Spanish)
 "Many people have asked: how was it possible to establish this company in Cuba? How was it possible to obtain the necessary permits and licenses? The answer is: I do not have a license; I do not have permission; I have not asked for it; and I am not going to ask for it."
SUPER CAPTION:  Philip Agee, Former CIA agent

Agee said he received funding for the tourism project from European investors, but declined to say how much or even who they are.

SOUNDBITE: (Spanish)
"If one asks for permission, one is submitting to the element of control that the fanatics in Miami exercise over US foreign policy."

The Web site, which has been partially running since February,  is to launch its first major promotion targeted at Americans - a week-long tour during carnival festivities in July and August.

Prices start at around  600 U-S dollars inclusive - although not including airfare, which must be arranged separately and through a third country.
