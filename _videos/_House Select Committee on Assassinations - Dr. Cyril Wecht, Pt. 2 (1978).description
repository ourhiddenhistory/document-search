I found a bit more of Dr. Wecht's testimony (about 30 mins). Part one can be found originally at blackopradio.com and here on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPOfwHI0CA8 and the testimony as a pdf can be found here: http://aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol1/pdf/HSCA_Vol1_0907_8_Wecht.pdf

All of the HSCA testimony and reports (including previously classified material made available under the JFK Act) are available for free at the amazing Assassination Archives Research Center's website here: http://aarclibrary.org/publib/contents/contents_hsca.htm
