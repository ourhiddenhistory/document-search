00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.210
here is a very long story I had already turned down an offer of

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.260
 enlist in the cia in my senior year of college but afterwards

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.109
 when I could no longer postpone my military service

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.869
 I remembered that I could do it in the context of the CIA with a certain sense

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.800
 I acted like an opportunist but it seemed much more interesting and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.059
 stimulating and taking part in covert operations and working within the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 secret services that do not peel potatoes and wash dishes under the arms even the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 the romantic factor naturally had a certain weight and above all I did

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.809
 was very interested in international business in the cia there are

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.620
 career officers like me who have the job of directing others

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.180
 people from various activities these people are called agents i would say i

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.140
 salaries are very good more than respectable but beyond what you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 earns salary then there are almost unlimited expenses paid by the CIA

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 now my salary was paid to me through the department of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.430
 state that he was officially a diplomat but the money to pay him

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.270
 agents I got it from the administrative officer inside

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.860
 of the embassy where the CIA offices were located

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.160
 he had a safe full of cash

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.470
 I took out the money and divided it into the wages of the people I paid

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.700
 each pay in an envelope that I slipped into my pocket to then deliver to people

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.590
 when I saw it on a street corner or inside a car and night depending on

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.640
 the type of operation

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.130
 when na in latin america in 1960 the cia program was to try to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.700
 stopping the spread of the influence of the urban revolution is one of the ways in which

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.600
 we worked against cuba it was trying to infiltrate them

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.369
 embassies through hidden microphones or by recruiting employees

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.959
 Cubans and also trying to induce all the governments of Latin America to

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.670
 interrupt diplomatic and commercial relations with cuba when i was living in

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.900
 Latin America and I saw every day the poverty and suffering of the great

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.980
 majority of the population I began to realize and eventually

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.440
 I decided that the liberal reforms are not a fraud in Latin America

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.310
 the only way in which the populations of Latin America will be able to change the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.540
 their society and through the armed struggle for the non-through the program

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.799
 of liberal reforms backed by the United States during the early years in which

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.310
 I lived

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.800
 I will not vote for it, no intention of having any active role against fiat

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.910
 after a while with the war in vietnam that many but goes etcetera

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.990
 I thought if I wrote a book telling about my work in the cia

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.310
 this would help Americans understand how it happened with the states

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.360
 united they had intervened in vietnam I wanted to make a contribution to the movement

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.920
 against the war in vietnam so I decided to write a black

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.300
 the eu has shrunk the worst enemy i ever dealt with either

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.520
 was the cia itself there were no dangerous friends but the danger is

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.750
 took over since i left china since i started writing books

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.000
 CIA articles got a ruling from a Washington federal court

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.319
 according to which I raise all my members subject to censorship by the CIA

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.310
 prior to publication this is clearly a reflection of the

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.930
 Reagan's new policy to tighten the ropes of security in the government of

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.860
 make it much harder for reporters and other people to know

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.330
 what's really going on
