The research and development program and particularly the co vert testing programs resulted in massive abridgments of the rights of American citizens sometimes with tragic consequences The deaths of two Americans can be attributed to these programs other participants in the testing programs may still suffer from the residual effects While some controlled testing of these substances might be de fended the nature of the tests their scale and the fact that they were continued for years after the danger of surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting individuals was known demonstrate a funda mental disregard for the value of human life The Select Committee's investigation of the testing and use of chemical and biological agents also raise serious questions about the adequacy of command and control procedures within the Central Intelligence Agency and military intelligence and about the relationships among the intelligence agencies other governmental agencies and private institutions and individuals The CIA's normal administrative controls were waived for programs involving chemical and biological agents to protect their security According to the head of the Audit Branch of the CIA these waivers produced "gross administrative failures. They prevented the CIA's internal review mechanisms (the Office of General Counsel the Inspector General and the Audit Staff) from adequately supervising the programs In general the waivers had the paradoxical effect of providing less restrictive administrative controls and less effective internal review for controversial and highly sensitive projects than those governing normal Agency activities The security of the programs was protected not only by waivers of normal administrative controls but also by a high degree of compartmentation within the CIA This compartmentation excluded the CIA's Medical Staff from the principal research and testing program employing chemical and biological agents It also may have led to agency policymakers receiving differing and inconsistent responses when they posed questions to the CIA component involved MKULTRA was the principal CIA program involving the research and development of chemical and biological agents It was "concerned with the research and development of chemical biological and radiological materials capable of employment in clandestine operations to control human behavior. 11 Research and development programs to find materials which could be used to alter human behavior were initiated in the late 1940s and early 1950s These experimental programs originally included testing of drugs involving witting human subjects and culminated in tests using unwitting nonvolunteer human subjects These tests were de signed to determine the potential effects of chemical or biological agents when used operationally against individuals unaware that they had received a drug The testing programs were considered highly sensitive by the in telligence agencies administering them In January 1973 MKULTRA records were destroyed by Technical Services Division personnel acting on the verbal orders of Dr Sidney Gottlieb Chief of TSD Dr Gottlieb
