SEPTEMBER 16, 2003 | Peter Kornbluh talked about the book he edited, The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability, published by New Press. The book draws information from recently declassified files containing information on Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet. The book, published on the 30th anniversary of General Pinochetâ€™s military coup, contains many of the secret records detailing U.S. government complicity with Pinochet. The narrative includes transcripts of Nixon, Kissinger and other cabinet members discussing how to dismantle the pro-Marxist Allende government. White House cables welcoming General Pinochet to power and CIA, National Security Council and State Department reports on the September 1976 car bombing deaths of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt are also included. Following his presentation, Mr. Kornbluh answered questions from the audience.
