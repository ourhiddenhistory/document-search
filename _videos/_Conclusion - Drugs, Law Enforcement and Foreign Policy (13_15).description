The Kerry Committee report, formally titled Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy, was the final report of an investigation by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations. The report examined the problems that drug cartels and drug money laundering in South and Central America and the Caribbean posed for American law enforcement and foreign policy. The Sub-Committee was chaired at the time by Senator John Kerry, so that the report is often referred to under his name.

The report was released on April 13, 1989, and included discussions of drug trafficking in the Bahamas, Colombia, Cuba and Nicaragua, Haiti, Honduras, and Panama. The longest chapter in the report was on narcotics trafficking and the Nicaraguan Contras. The Subcommittee "did not find that Contra leaders were personally involved in drug trafficking," but it did find "substantial evidence" of drug smuggling by "individual Contras, Contra suppliers, Contra pilots, mercenaries who worked with the Contras, and Contra supporters."
