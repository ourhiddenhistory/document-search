Kathie Sarachild is interviewed on KPFA's "Unlearning to not speak" program by Susan Elisabeth. Sarachild is a member of the Redstockings radical feminist group which has just published a "warning" that Gloria Steinem and MS Magazine (Steinem is editor) may be fronts for the CIA and powers that be to block progress on feminist issues such as the exploitation of women. Focus is on Steinem's political history since the 1960s and her association with the Independent Research Service, which is believed to have been used by the CIA to block Communist youth activities in Finland and in Europe. Suspicions and warnings are being published in the Redstockings Journal. Other articles are cited in other publications on this issue. Produced by Susan Elisabeth.
