Kennedy: The Performance of the Intelligence Agencies (Book 5 Section 4). This is a recording of Section IV of Book 5, The Intelligence Agencies and the Warren Commission.

About Book 5 of the Church Committee Report (from the Mary Ferrel Website): "The Church Committee also conducted a limited investigation of the Kennedy assassination, focusing on how well the FBI and CIA supported the Warren Commission. This short report sharply faulted those agencies, stating that the Committee 'developed evidence which impeaches the process by which the intelligence agencies arrived at their own conclusions about the assassination, and by which they provided information to the Warren Commission. This evidence indicates that the investigation of the assassination was deficient.'"
