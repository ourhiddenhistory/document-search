could get this signal at several

some kind of transmitter you know that's

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:50.290 align:start position:0%
how they actually find that's right and
 

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
how they actually find that's right and
that's<00:18:50.680><c> how</c><00:18:50.890><c> they</c><00:18:51.040><c> could</c><00:18:51.220><c> find</c><00:18:51.430><c> the</c><00:18:51.580><c> box</c><00:18:51.790><c> which</c>

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:52.090 align:start position:0%
that's how they could find the box which
 

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.330 align:start position:0%

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.340 align:start position:0%
is where they found me and so I began to
