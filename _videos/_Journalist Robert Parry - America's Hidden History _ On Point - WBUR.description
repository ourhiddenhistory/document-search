"Investigative reporter Robert Parry is the kind of relentless digger that no small part of the American news media find too hot to handle. He went deep, back in the day, on American hostages, the “October surprise,” and the election of Ronald Reagan. He went deep on Iran-Contra and the adventures of the CIA in the cocaine trade. He’s still at it, writing and publishing unpopular truths. And talking about how too often we don’t know our own living history. And the news media’s not telling us. He just won the I.F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence.  This hour On Point, tough reporter Robert Parry."
