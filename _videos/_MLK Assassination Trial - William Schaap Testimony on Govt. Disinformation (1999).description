IMPROVED AUDIO: From the Martin Luther King Jr. Assassination Civil Trial, in which a Memphis jury concluded that King had been assassinated by a government conspiracy. This 1.25 hour clip is the testimony of attorney, author, and publisher William Schapp (publisher of Covert Action Quarterly). Schaap discusses US government - and especially FBI - disinformation efforts throughout the nation's history including efforts directed at Dr. King. Mr. Schaap is being questioned by King Family attorney William F. Pepper.

Issues discussed: Church Committee findings, FBI relationship with the US media, COINTELPRO, COMINFIL

Note on the audio: I've tried to lower the background noise and raise the overall level.
