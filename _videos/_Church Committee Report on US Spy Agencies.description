In a panel titled, “Who’s Watching the Spies: Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans -- A Look Back at the Church Committee Report,” the panel members discussed the work of the committee. The “Church Committee” refers to the U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, chaired by Senator Frank Church (D-ID) in 1975-1976. It was the precursor to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,

The Church committee uncovered episodes in which the government spied on Americans and, thereupon, it drafted many of the laws central to the current debates regarding warrantless wiretaps.

Former Vice President Walter Mondale and Senator Walter Huddleston were members of the Church committee. Fred Schwartz was chief counsel to the committee. 

The event was held in Memorial Hall. It was also co-sponsored by the School of Journalism and Telecommunications and the First Amendment Center.
