AUGUST 10, 1992 | Rep. Brooks, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Schumer, member of the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Rose, member of the House Agriculture Committee, spoke in a news conference to comment on the Department of Justice refusal to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate U.S. policy toward Iraq prior to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The three legislators had signed a letter from members of the House urging the Department of Justice appoint a special prosecutor to investigate how much the U.S. aided Iraq’s military and industrial expansion in the 1980's. Rep. Brooks called the Department of Justice refusal an “affront” to the American people and said it amounts to “stonewalling” on the issue.
