From kennedysandking.com: "In this remarkable Pacifica interview from the Sixties, Mort Sahl reveals how his career was ruined, as he lost two broadcast programs in Los Angeles and he was blackballedâ€”not due to ratings, which were good, but because he would not be quiet about the JFK assassination.

Thanks to Our Hidden History for this transcript, which reveals more of the censorship of the JFK case by the media."
