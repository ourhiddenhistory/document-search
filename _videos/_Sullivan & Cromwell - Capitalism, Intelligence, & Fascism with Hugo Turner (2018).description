Few realize the role corporate lawyers have played in shaping the past 150 years of world history. Sullivan & Cromwell is perhaps the most infamous example. It oversaw the birth of the multinational corporation and launched coups in third world countries decades before there was an OSS or CIA. It was a key player in building up the German war machine. It helped shape international law allowing the holocaust to occur. It’s ties to Germany led it to commit treason helping Germany undermine America’s war effort. It undermined all attempts to reign in corporate power. It’s most infamous partners were John Foster Dulles future Secretary of State and Allen Dulles the most influential CIA director in the agency’s history. Even before rising to those heights the Dulles Brothers helped launch the cold war and helped the Nazis escape justice while putting the Nazis’ German corporate backers, who made fortunes off slave labor and the Holocaust (as did their American and European partners) back into power. While in office the Dulles Brothers carried out the will of Sullivan and Cromwell’s clients by launching coups in Guatemala and Iran.  Sullivan & Cromwell partners became Senators, Ambassadors, a Supreme court Justice. Sullivan Cromwell partners also sat on the board of directors of their clients the multinational corporations.
