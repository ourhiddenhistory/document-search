Philip Agee blew the whistle on CIA skulduggery in the 1970's. He is the reason why Valerie Plame's outing became an issue. Three Mexican Presidents were CIA!  Philip Agee in his book CIA DIARY laid it all bare. CIA took compromising pictures of these presidents while engaged in sexual acts! This has allowed the USA to take over Mexico covertly. His book is corroborated by the NSA ARCHIVE.
