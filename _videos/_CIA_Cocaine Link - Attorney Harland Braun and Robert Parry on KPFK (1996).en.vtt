00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:16.330 align:start position:0%
would just come out and tell the truth
 

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
would just come out and tell the truth
and<00:22:16.570><c> we'll</c><00:22:16.660><c> get</c><00:22:16.810><c> it</c><00:22:16.870><c> over</c><00:22:17.110><c> where</c><00:22:17.260><c> that's</c>

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:17.470 align:start position:0%
and we'll get it over where that's
 

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.350 align:start position:0%
and we'll get it over where that's
fairly<00:22:18.010><c> inconsistent</c><00:22:18.730><c> with</c><00:22:18.820><c> their</c><00:22:18.910><c> pattern</c>

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
fairly inconsistent with their pattern

fairly inconsistent with their pattern
so<00:22:19.510><c> I</c><00:22:19.540><c> think</c><00:22:19.810><c> it'll</c><00:22:19.960><c> probably</c><00:22:20.230><c> happen</c><00:22:20.850><c> it'll</c>

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:21.850 align:start position:0%
so I think it'll probably happen it'll
 

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
so I think it'll probably happen it'll
take<00:22:22.030><c> us</c><00:22:22.180><c> several</c><00:22:22.300><c> years</c><00:22:22.810><c> for</c><00:22:22.960><c> the</c><00:22:23.020><c> thing</c><00:22:23.230><c> to</c>

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:23.350 align:start position:0%
take us several years for the thing to
