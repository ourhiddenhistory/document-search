Author Christopher Simpson discusses his book entitled "Blow Back: America's Recruitment of Nazis and its Effect on the Cold War." Simpson's interest in the topic started during the deportation trial of Otto Van Bolschwing, who argued against deportation because the CIA had brought him in. Simpson has attained information through the Freedom of Information Act. The United States sought all operatives to combat Soviet "expansionism" at the end of World War II.
