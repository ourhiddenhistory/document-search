"Horrible, bloody, military dictatorships in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Brazil. All of those were put in with help from the CIA and they overthrew elected civilian democratic governments.

STORYLINE
Renegade former CIA agent Philip Agee, whose naming of agency operatives helped prompt a U.S. Law against exposing government spies, has died in Cuba, his wife said Wednesday. He was 72.
Agee quit the CIA in 1969 after 12 years working mostly in Latin America at a time when leftist movements were gaining prominence and sympathisers. His 1975 book "Inside the Company: CIA Diary," cited alleged CIA misdeeds against leftists in the region and included a 22-page list of purported agency operatives.
Granma, Cuba's Communist Party newspaper, also said Agee died on Monday night and described him as "a loyal friend of Cuba and fervent defender of the peoples' fight for a better world."
Bernie Dwyer, a journalist with state-run Radio Havana, said in a Tuesday message posted to a Cuba e-mail group that Agee's wife called him to say he had died after ulcer surgery in a hospital where he has he been since Dec. 15.
"He had several operations for perforated ulcers and didn't survive all the surgery," Dwyer wrote, adding that Agee was cremated on Tuesday and that friends planned a memorial ceremony for him om Sunday at his Havana apartment.
Agee's U.S. passport was revoked in 1979. U.S. officials said he had threatened national security. After years of living in Hamburg, Germany _ occasionally underground, fearing CIA retribution _ Agee moved to Havana to open a travel Web site.
The site, cubalinda.com, is designed to bring U.S. tourists to Cuba, offering package tours and other help that is largely off-limits to Americans because of the U.S. trade embargo. Agee opened the site in 2000 with European investors and a state-run travel agent as his partners.
There was no mention of Agee's death on the site on Wednesday.
The author of several other books besides "Inside the Company," one of Agee's last essays was published in Granma International newspaper in 2003 and came shortly after a Cuban government crackdown led to the arrest of 75 leading dissidents and political activists.
"To think that the dissidents were creating an independent, free civil society is absurd, for they were funded and controlled by a hostile foreign power and to that degree, which was total, they were not free or independent in the least," he wrote.
Agee has been accused of receiving up to 1 million (m) US dollars in payments from the Cuban intelligence service. He denied the accusations, which were first made by a high-ranking Cuban intelligence officer and defector in a 1992 report.
