"My role in exposing CIA people back in the 1970's was political. It was for political reasons based on what the people were doing in the CIA around the world in terms of promotion of political repression and torture and forced disappearances and so forth."

6. SOUNDBITE (English): Philip Agee, former CIA Agent:
"It happens that I wrote my first book, which had all the names, in the 1970s and this was the same time that there were horrible, bloody, military dictatorships in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Brazil. All of those were put in with help from the CIA and they overthrew elected civilian democratic governments. I wanted to fight against this, and against the human rights violations that were being carried out in these countries. I only mention those because you could mention Vietnam, you could mention the Philippines, you could mention the whole world for that matter in terms of the political repression that the CIA has caused through the years."

"It's all based on a pack of lies and the same Bush family, not only this president, but his mother and his father are of the same cut. They lie in public all the time and I know that from personal experience."

STORYLINE: 
Philip Agee, a former CIA agent who caused outrage by naming former colleagues, has died following ulcer surgeries, Cuban state media reported Wednesday. He was 72.
Agee quit the CIA in 1969 after 12 years working mostly in Latin America at a time when leftist movements were gaining prominence and sympathisers.
His 1975 book 'Inside the Company: CIA Diary' alleged CIA misdeeds against leftists in the region and included a 22-page list of purported agency operatives, infuriating US officials who said it had endangered agents' lives.
At an AP interview on 10 February 2003 Agee said one his motivations for writing the controversial book was because he wanted to speak out against the CIA whom he claims at the time helped but in place 'horrible, bloody, military dictatorships' throughout South America
"All of those were put in with help from the CIA and they overthrew elected civilian democratic governments. I wanted to fight against this, and against the human rights violations that were being carried out in these countries."
During the same interview Agee went on to accuse the Bush family of being complicit in such CIA political interventions, saying that they 'lie in public.' 
Agee's U.S. passport was revoked in 1979. After years of living in Germany occasionally underground, fearing CIA retribution he moved to Havana.
Granma, Cuba's Communist Party newspaper, said Agee died Monday night and described him as 'a loyal friend of Cuba and fervent defender of the peoples' fight for a better world.'
In 2000, Agee joined European investors and a state-run travel agent in opening a Web site to bring American tourists to Cuba. The site, cubalinda.com, offers package tours and other help with Cuban tourism that is largely outlawed for Americans.
One of Agee's last essays was published in Granma International newspaper in May 2003 shortly after a Cuban government crackdown led to the arrest of 75 leading dissidents and political activists.
