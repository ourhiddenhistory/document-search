Unfortunately, CSPAN cuts Agent Hosty's answer early. Quite unfortunate, but what he does say and his sheepish attitude is pretty telling.

In response to an astute audience questioner, FBI Agent James Hosty attempts to explain why he destroyed important evidence in the assassination of John F. Kennedy - a note from Lee Harvey Oswald to the FBI. 

He offers such answers as "I was only following orders" and "Hoover could get very angry". He notes that his act was only "not a crime" because Oswald was executed in the Dallas Police Headquarters, and therefore the note wasn't "evidence" because Oswald was dead and could not be tried. Quite lucky.

Agent Hosty might have spared us his theories about Cubans and the KGB agents and nuclear war and instead focused on explaining *his* criminal actions in the wake of the assassination.
