MEDICAL EVIDENCE ABOUT THE JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION / Carl Oglesby interviewed and produced by Bob Young.

Carl Ogelsby examines the medical evidence which exists concerning the cause of John F. Kennedy's death. He looks at the Parkland Trama Room, the death pronouncement, Parkland surgeon Dr. Crenshaw's book "Conspiracy of Silence," and the possible complicity of the AMA in the Bethesda National Hospital rebuttal of the book. He also discusses David Lifton's book "Best Evidence," which suggests surgery might have been performed on the body between the assassination and examination 6 hours later. Oglesby then provides a personal account of his investigation in the Kennedy assassination, starting in 1973. He concludes with an examination of current film and medical depictions of events.
