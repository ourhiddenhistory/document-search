Joseph McBride is an accomplished professor, journalist, film historian, and author. He is the author of 20 books, including a new book, which came out in June entitled, 'How Did Lubitsch Do It?' about Ernst Lubitsch, a famed Hollywood comedic film director. He's also the author of what we're going to talk about today, 'Into the Nightmare: My Search for the Killer of President John F. Kennedy and Officer J.D. Tippit'. Mr. McBride became prominent nationally in 1988 for uncovering an FBI document from J. Edgar Hoover listing George H.W. Bush as a member of the CIA in contact with anti-Castro Cubans at the time of the Kennedy assassination, a finding that has been basically like an earthquake in changing the way that people understand the history of the Bush family.
