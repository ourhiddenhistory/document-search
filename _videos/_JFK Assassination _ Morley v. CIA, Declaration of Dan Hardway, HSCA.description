In 2003, reporter Jefferson Morley (jfkfacts.org) brought a lawsuit against the Central Intelligence Agency (http://aarclibrary.org/morley-v-cia-petition-update/). Morley sought to get important documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy released to the public. As of 2016, the CIA has still refused to release these documents. 

The following is a legal declaration which was submitted as part of Morely's lawsuit. It has been made by a former congressional investigator who, like Morley, also found himself stonewalled by the CIA while trying to look into the murder of JFK.

Jefferson Morley is the editor at http://jfkfacts.org and the author of several books on the CIA and the JFK Assassination.

His lawyer in this case is James Lesar. Mr. Lesar also runs the Assassination Archives and Research Center, a massive library of documents about all of the assassinations of the '60s. http://aarclibrary.org/

From the Declaration:

48. The photograph of George Joannides that Mr. Morley did obtain through his FOIA request would have been invaluable had it been available to the HSCA staff in 1977 and 1978. The CIA repeatedly told the HSCA that they had no contact with DRE in 1963. The leaders of the DRE, however, told members of the HSCA staff, that they had an CIA case officer in 1963 who went by the name of "Howard." Had the HSCA staff had that photograph in 1978 it would have led to an identification of George Joannides then. Jefferson Morley, after obtaining the photograph through his FOIA request, showed the photograph to three surviving members ofthe DRE, Luis Rocha, Jose Antonio Lanuza, and Manuel Salvat, who each, individually and separately, identified the photograph as the CIA case officer known to them as "Howard" in 1963 The identification of the photograph provides independent confirmation of Joannides's assignment in 1963 and prevents further prevarication on the issue by the CIA thereby settling an issue of significant public interest in the JFK investigation. 49. After David Atlee Phillips testified a second time before the HSCA in Executive Session on April 25,1978, several staff members, myself included, sought to have the Chief Counsel recommend to the Committee that it refer Mr. Phillips to the Justice Department for prosecution for lying to Congress. That was not done. While recommendations were made to the Justice Department at the close of the Committee's work regarding further investigations, none of the recommendations referred to Mr. Phillips or his activities. Had we known then what we have learned since 1978 about Mr. Phillips' and Mr. Joannides's activities, I firmly believe that the results would have been much different than they were. I believe that, at a minimum, the information would have led to a Lying to Congress charge against David Atlee Phillips and a strong recommendation that the activities of the CIA, George Joannides, David Atlee Phillips and Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans, Dallas and Mexico City be subjected to further, additional, intense investigation. Such is the nature ofthe information. Consequently, I think it should be clear that the information sought by Mr. Morley in his July 4, 2003, FOIA request that specifically dealt with the underlying facts from 1963 and the CIA's active cover-up of that information in 1978, are of the greatest possible public interest. While revelation of that information caimot have the same effect it would have had in 1978, or 1963, it continues to be of great historical interest as well as being of great practical and political import to the nature and functioning of our democracy. 

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
