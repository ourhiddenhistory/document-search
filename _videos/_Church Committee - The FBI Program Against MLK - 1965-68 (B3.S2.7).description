From the introduction: "From December 1963 until his death in 1968 Martin Luther King, Jr was the target of an intensive campaign by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'neutralize him as an effective civil rights leader'. In the words of the man in charge of the FBI's war against Dr King: 'No holds were barred We have used [similar] techniques against Soviet agents [The same methods were] brought
home against any organization against which we were targeted. We did not differentiate This is a rough tough business.' The FBI collected information about Dr King's plans and activities through an extensive surveillance program employing nearly every intelligence-gathering technique at the Bureau's disposal." 

This report describes that attempt to "neutralize' Dr. King.
