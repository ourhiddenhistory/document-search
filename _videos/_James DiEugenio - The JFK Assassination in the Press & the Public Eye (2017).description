James DiEugenio is a veteran author and researcher lately focusing on JFK's foreign policy. He's the author of 'Reclaiming Parkland' (https://www.amazon.com/Reclaiming-Parkland-Vincent-Bugliosi-Assassina/dp/1626365334) and 'Destiny Betrayed: JFK, Cuba, and the Garrison Case' (https://www.amazon.com/Destiny-Betrayed-Cuba-Garrison-Case/dp/1620870568), now in its second edition. He's a regular guest on Len Osanic's Black Op Radio (http://blackopradio.com), he writes for Robert Parry's Consortium News (https://consortiumnews.com/), and he's the principal behind one of the most active and important assassination websites, http://www.KennedysAndKing.com, which is constantly updated with new articles, book reviews, and important news about the assassinations of both JFK, RFK, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., among a lot of other interesting items.

We covered the ebb and flow of the public perception of the case as it played out in the media and in official investigations. It's a good look at the 50 years of the long-term cover up in the press and in officialdom, and on efforts of people like the early researchers and others - like Jim Garrison, and Oliver Stone - to bring the facts of the case to light. We look too at what some of the official investigations uncovered - like the House Select Committee and the board created by the 1993 JFK Act - and assessed their impact, if any, on the story being put out by the US press. We end by seeing what the 2017 releases might mean and whether or not the press and official story will ever fully grapple with the facts of the murder of John F. Kennedy.
