It includes detailed descriptions of the history and functions of the agencies of the U.S. government engaging in foreign intelligence, including the CIA, State Department, and Department of Defense.

From the report: "No activity of the Central Intelligence Agency has engendered more controversy and concern than "covert action", the secret use of power and persuasion. The contemporary definition of covert action as used by the CIA -- "any clandestine operation or activity designed to influence foreign governments organizations persons or events in support of United States foreign policy" -- suggests an all-purpose policy tool. By definition, covert action should be one of the CIA's least visible activities, yet it has attracted more attention in recent years than any other United States foreign intelligence activity. The CIA has been accused of interfering in the internal political affairs of nations ranging from Iran to Chile, from Tibet to Guatemala, from Libya to Laos, from Greece to Indonesia. Assassinations, coups d'etat, vote buying, economic warfare -- all have been laid at the doorstep of the CIA. Few political crises take place in the world today in which CIA involvement is not alleged. As former Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford
told the Committee:

'The knowledge regarding such operations has become so widespread that our country has been accused of being responsible for practically every internal difficulty that has occurred in every country in the world.'"
