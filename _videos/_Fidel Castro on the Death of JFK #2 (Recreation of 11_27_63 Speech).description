But here we see the strange case of the alleged murderer shooting from the place where he works. This is not the act of an individual who intends to get away with it —that is, not a fanatic, but somebody who was hired to do the job. No one trying to get away with such an act would perform the attack from the site itself where he works, where he's going to be identified just in five minutes, where within five minutes he will be fiercely persecuted everywhere. He would have gone to the roof of another building, he would have rented an apartment along the path, he would have placed himself with his telescopic rifle at a distance that would have allowed him to escape. It is very strange that an individual --- where he works, where he will be identified within five minutes --- would carry out a an act like that from there and then, at the same time, try to escape. That makes no sense, no sense. After our hearing we have obtained new data: information from the newspaper "Excelsior" from Mexico, that this man had visited the Consulate of Cuba and the Soviet Union to obtain a transit visa to Cuba and the Soviet Union. Immediately we inquire with our consular officers. The newspaper's version is very objective; it explained how the individual had left in disgust, slamming the door, because they had not issued him a visa. We requested for information and found it was true that in September the 27th he had shown up at our Consulate in Mexico, had requested a visa, had been explained that the consulate couldn't issue that visa without authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which, in turn, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not grant such transit visas if the country of destination did not grant them. In addition, in our consular offices many visa applications are requested, and usually our officials are very cautious, very conservative in that sense. Because we have to assume that the enemy is constantly trying to send agents here, and so many measures are taken. We just don't grant a visa to anyone who requests it; we have to perfectly know their background. Therefore, the official denied him a visa. Now, on the next day, Saturday night, barely 24 hours after the Kennedy's death, agents of the Federal Police of Mexico arrested the employee of our consulate— which has Mexican citizenship —and also her husband. What for and why was she arrested? She was arrested for questioning and interrogating her in a brutal manner, mistreating, insinuating alleged links with the Kennedy's accused murderer, trying to get some information through coercion....How could he make anyone believe that he acted for emotional reasons? Possibly we've never see greater scandal! Possibly the worst gangsters never even acted more crudely, more awkwardly, more outrageously! This shows that those responsible for Kennedy's death needed, they were urged to remove the accused at all costs. They were imperiously urged for some reason, possibly for him not to speak; they were urged to eliminate him and safely removed him. Once the alleged murderer was eliminated, police and judicial authorities of Dallas declared the case closed, as if it had been not the President of the United States but a dog murdered on the street, and declared the case closed in 48 hours. They closed the case when the case was becoming less closable, when the case was becoming more mysterious, when the case was becoming more suspicious, when the case was becoming more investigable from the judicial and penal point of view. I am sure that no judge acting as such, would objectively close any case in circumstances such as this, in which the main accused is killed. Of course we carefully read the reports where the news about the second murder was consigned, and especially those of the UPI. Immediately the same emphasis the IPU had placed to present Oswald as a communist follower, as a Castro-communist, as an admirer of Castro, they placed it to present this gentleman, Jack Ruby, as an admirer of Kennedy, a great admirer of Kennedy
