 Puerto Rico is a Latin American nation militarily intervened

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:56.410
 by the U.S. government since 1898 the geographic extent of our

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.829
 territory in the city is just over 9000 square kilometers

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.770
 However, we would be wrong if we conclude by this fact of the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.720
 occupation of our island is of minimal importance to the government

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.140

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.120
 North American capital in Puerto Rico exceeds nine billion dollars

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.400
 the fabulous profits made as a result of these investments are more

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.740
 larger than those that would be obtained from the same investments made in the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.710
 continental United States in more specific terms Puerto Rico

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.370
 constitutes the fifth US market in the world and the second in America.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.530
 economic interests of North American capital in our country

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.120

 to America

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.480
 one of the most important functions served by political and military intervention

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.410
 what are we victims of

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.700
 sorry one of the most important functions the intervention serves

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.629
 political and military of which we are victims in economic exploitation but

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.510
 again we would make a mistake if we limit

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.150
 the importance of our colonial condition to the economic aspect

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.500
 US imperialism has for years used Puerto Rico as a bridge for

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.050
 penetration to the rest of Latin America and the world

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.089
 [Music]

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.650
 merkel world the intervention of the us government in

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.450
 our country is of such magnitude

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.450
 At the present time we can affirm that Puerto Rico is one of the countries

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.600
 where more intelligence and repressive agencies

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.030
 more US intelligence and law enforcement agencies operate across

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.390
 the world the intelligence of the army and the navy operate in Puerto Rico

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.460
 federal court operates openly and virtually all laws passed

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.490
 by the US Congress they are applied in our country to this we must add the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.240
 made of the intelligence agencies of the colony administration its courts of

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.870
 justice as well as the rest of its repressive apparatus the colonial administration

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.240
 is receiving millions of dollars from

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.460
 North American federal government through established programs directed

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.070
 towards the repression by the us congress

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.780
 these old penguins in addition to our clientele being presidents

00:05:27.580 --> 00:06:01.910
 in these questions we used to go to

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.520
 joke about our luck saying the fbi operated in port

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.139
 rich because he considered us part of the North American territory and the company

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:18.320
 operated because it considered us as foreign territory now we are not

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.130
 sure of them after the discovery of the domestic division

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:29.090
 of the chair and its activities in the usa it is important that as much is possible

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.130
 that both the chairs and the fbi agree that our island is a

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:40.520
 territory belonging to the US government what is really important is

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.810
 that we Puerto Ricans continue to consider ourselves a

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.240
 intervened nation in Latin America

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.610
 repression

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.910
 used by the federal government in current Puerto Rico in every possible way

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.380
 to stop the process of our people's struggle for their independence

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:51.199
 national and what it represents in terms of our social justice

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:56.600
 intervention at this time is aimed at demonstrating

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.940

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:26.850
 in this month the severity of the operations of the cia

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:32.310
 in our country do not lie solely in the fact that

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:37.470
 whether it is an intelligence agency the intelligence agency in fact

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.050
 They exist around the world and will unfortunately continue to exist

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:47.250
 to the extent that the causes and the interests that make them prevail

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:53.709
 function because the main problem with regard to the

00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:56.850
 Central Intelligence Agency

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.040
 It is not the systems and methods that they use in their operation but to

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.040
 who serves even those methods and those means that the chair uses are

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:15.440
 determined precisely by the interests the agency serves

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.710
 from business that is, it is presented with natural dyes tri water bacteria

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:49.540
 the central intelligence agency in our country serves the powerful and

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.129
 the interests that benefit from colonial intervention at the cost of life

00:09:54.129 --> 00:09:58.779
 and the work of the Puerto Rican workers jobs at the same time

00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:04.779
 as we mentioned before we are used as a territory of center of

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:10.320
 operations in relation to the rest of Latin America and the world

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.680
 we remember how we have been used as showcases of democracy like the anti cuba

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.230
 However, this image that has been sold to Latin America is

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.850
 deteriorates to the extent that our economy is deteriorating and

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.920
 continuously develops the economy and social justice in the

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.580

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.700
 Latin America and our link to the rectum between

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:26.200
 Latin America and the United States and the active struggle for the independence of Puerto Rico

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.410
 during the present decade explains the scenario

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.269
 where the activities of the

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:42.120
 company in our country if we understand the interests of whom the chair serves

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:48.320
 and who represents those interests in Puerto Rico we will be in a position to

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:55.340
 understand why the agency operates so actively in our country

00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:03.080
 the first with people with this act and then it was independent

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:10.310

 Inert in three swords swallowed by big nine entertainment supposedly

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.660
 There are websites of 70 projects on the field, one of the things that first

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.670
 does the chair where the conditions are given is to support the policy of the

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.980
 parties that represent the status quo and protect the interests they serve

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:46.580
 the chair an eloquent example of this is the support provided by the cia to the party

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.950
 Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei in Chile

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:56.800
 in our country it is a known fact that the cia supported the popular party

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:04.060
 In the 1972 elections, the CIA channeled around one million

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.740
 dollars in this party for its electoral campaign and the popular party

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.480
 democratic won the elections

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.360
 coverage for this maneuver was made possible through the holding of a

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:24.270
 telemarathon where the so-called popular party supposedly connected more than one

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:29.200
 million and a half dollars in less than 10 hours

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.810
 however we look at it, it is impossible to collect this amount of

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.940
 money in that kind of activity in our country in the end of time

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.920
 that we have pointed out later, it was widely known that

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:52.540
 agencies used banks located in the Bahamas to provide these funds

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.450
 well later I have the video that sells that indecency this strong public for

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:04.570

 never once is the government established or

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:59.459
 the colonial administration that has been supported by the cia agency guarantees

00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:04.680
 that its policy is implemented under the placement of agents and creating their

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.879
 own ties with this government there should be no doubts about the particular

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:14.680

 figueres expression in the americas this color defect said they smoke in 33 and

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:52.779
 I come to those who question those of favor in Puerto Rico to cite a single

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:58.259
 example during the administration of governor roberto sánchez vilella de

00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:07.240
 From 1964 to 68 his main assistant was a CIA agent, it is no secret that he

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.410
 prominent Puerto Rican professor and lawyer Juan Manuel García

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:17.800
 Passalacqua was in charge of this liaison function between the guides and the

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.790
 colonial administration of Puerto Rico while serving as an assistant

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:27.579
 Special Governor Sánchez Vilella himself has privately mentioned the

00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:31.600
 problems he encountered during his administration as a result of the

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:38.550

 administration despite the activity of the company and

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:11.589
 other intelligence agencies and repressive our fight for the

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:17.019
 Independence continues to develop stronger and stronger as a result of

00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:22.839
 This increases the activity of the agency the practice of the CIA

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:27.610
 falsify documents related to organizations to which you fight is

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:32.890
 widely known, this practice has been used in Puerto Rico since the

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:39.159
 beginning at least the 60's before the electoral strike campaign

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:43.570
 carried out by the pro-independence movement, the historical predecessor of the

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:48.100
 Puerto Rican socialist party documents favoring at that time

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:54.840
 electoral participation and signed by groups by supposed groups of the mp and

00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.309
 appeared, it was then immediately verified that these documents were

00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:08.990
 false and that said groups did not exist in the same way in 1967 false documents

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.280
 signed on behalf of the youth of the pro-independence movement were

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.550

 in this session

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:18.660
 journalists have been very upset on many occasions by the use that the company

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:24.780
 has made their profession as coverage in Puerto Rico not only have they used the

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:30.810
 profession but they control news agencies completely the only

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.410
 news agencies that operate in our country are unit press

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:40.230
 international and associated press the international united press office in

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:45.090
 sant web cannot publish anything that happens in the organization of the

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:50.750
 United Nations related to Puerto Rico without the specific permission of the

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:56.340
 new york office and it is not a mere inner workings of the

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:36.100
 it is then web rating this is the result of the penetration

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:42.070
 of the cia in the news media in the country we must add, for example, that the

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:47.650
 most of the country's newspapers are part of this censorship campaign

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.520
 in relation to our case in the united nations

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.210
 we will briefly return to the penetration of the cia in the media

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.890
 mass communication Puerto Rico when we talk about the current operation that

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:06.990
 develops the agency in relation to the union movement at this time

00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:23.399
 connections organization rests more communications medium

00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:29.059
 current moment strong pressures by no means

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.640
 sometimes there are works that the official instruments of repression do not

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:40.210
 they must not want or cannot carry out the cia intervenes in these cases the help

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.980
 given by the agency to the right-wing organization Patria Libertad in Chile is

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:50.620
 widely known the cia has supported right-wing paramilitary groups in

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.770
 Puerto Rico these groups originated from the

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:58.990
 Cuban exiles and some right-wing extremists in some sectors of the

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.540
 our youth the independence movement and its

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:09.390
 organization is has been the victim of more than 125 armed attacks in the last

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.620
 four years firearms bomb attacks

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.200
 etcetera far from having doubts about the

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.520
 participation of the cia in these attacks we have positive evidence of

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.470
 such participation we have publicly denounced these organizations for

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:32.020
 his name as the front of the chair in the case of Cuban exiles we have

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:38.200
 publicly denounced that the man was Sergio Ramos- Cuban exile and employee

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.270
 Government is the link of the cia in our country that coordinates the actions

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:48.280
 of these underground groups with mr freddy valentine mr valentine

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.710
 is the person responsible for coordinating some sectors of the youth that

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:58.780
 we spoke before belonging to the new progressive pro statesman party

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:04.350
 and the group known as jhon americas for freedom

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.189
 [Music]

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.220
 do not

00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:47.419
 fans are in shape

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:06.919
 per se

00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:26.010
 from westford and after sun in chubut monday leaving look who they were

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:31.110
 two additional aspects about it number one no one has been charged and

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:36.180
 convicted of these attacks, the last of which was the placement of a

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.500
 bomb in an illegal public act of the Puerto Rican socialist party on

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:46.140
 last January 11 where two workers died and number two this activity

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.730
 it is not directed exclusively against the pro-independence organizations all

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.630
 the Latin American consulates whose governments have reestablished relations

00:24:54.630 --> 00:25:00.920
 diplomats with Cuba have been attacked with bombs in the case of the infiltration

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.910
 enter the leftist organizations and the creation of organizations

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:09.960
 divisionist ghosts and provocative groups

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.820
 We have found a more direct participation of the FBI in Puerto Rico without

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:20.420
 exclude the more sophisticated participation of the and

00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:26.289
 do not

00:25:44.499 --> 00:26:00.590
 of amusement so that your wifi how many people are there

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:05.930
 nothing explore demonstrates this type of expressions from there finally

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:10.490
 we want to denounce an intelligence operation that at this moment

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:16.720
 develops the cia in our country against the union movement

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.650
 i

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.700
 first we want to cite a very brief part of an article recently

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.780
 published by professor wilfredo mattos who appeared in the newspaper

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.130
 daily clarity

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.020
 we say the article should study the experiences of others

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:54.180
 countries where the central intelligence agency has operated in the movement

00:26:54.180 --> 00:27:00.840
 union we can take an example recently offered in the book the

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:07.250
 politics of heroin insalud southeast asia

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:18.799
 leave mike mccoy the place refers to france the year 1947 the french cgt

00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:24.600
 was leading a general strike that had practically paralyzed the entire

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.000
 country the communist party

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:35.330
 it was the party with the greatest influence within the oil immediately after

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:40.160
 sectors belonging to the socialist party began the strike

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.900
 French non-Marxist Leninist social democratic party

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:53.300
 he excluded himself from the cgt forming a new central called workers' power according to

00:27:53.300 --> 00:28:00.300
 with mccoy's quotes about division director tomás breide

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:06.360
 international news of the cia that appeared on May 20, 1967 in the edition of the

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.910
 evening post workshop the company was backing this group called power

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:19.040
 worker and also linked in some way to the French socialist party

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:50.090
 and then after a period of serving as a source, the paths of the

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.770
 bridge for the court

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:09.910
 sporting in the cold war center

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.020
 international

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.350
 later the professor mato continues in the same article wondering are we

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:38.280
 perhaps we in Puerto Rico- immune to the actions of the chair there is no

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.960
 given conditions of our country so that with the development of the movement

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.900
 worker for the chair to consider dissociative actions in that area

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:53.850
 serving the interests of American capitalism and the bourgeoisie of the

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:59.700
 people's party and the so-called new progressive party all over the world who

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.740
 know the labor movement in Puerto Rico and the growth that is

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:10.950
 experienced in the past years should conclude the above new leaders

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:17.730
 unions are emerging working together with old union leaders

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.930
 who have remained true to the interests of the working class

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.680
 deterioration

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:31.730
 of the capitalist projects in the colony it is evident

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:40.400
 and the working class accelerates its struggle a party of the working class arises

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:46.970
 with new structures and unions and parties come together in an effort

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:51.470
 to increase the capacity of the workers against in the fight

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:55.790
 against the employers of course we are referring in

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:59.980
 the union plane to the labor movement min

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.990
 in this professional setting

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:22.049
 because then it is good to take advantage of the eggs after living well

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.350
 workman

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.620
 experiences

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:39.880
 again of English stoner the projections in classes and

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:46.000
 wishing you excellent your web net work english by day you are missing extraction and

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.280
 instigating trade unions in cash in crystals capable of activating this bank

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.990
 and turn on the qwest river in front of network management

00:31:55.990 --> 00:32:00.730
 here we want to refer to the fact that the chair's attempts to divide the

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.990
 trade union movement and minimize the influence of the socialist party

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.820
 Puerto Rican among said movement has had the full support of the press

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:16.450
 commercial as a matter of fact there is more than one so-called journalist linked to

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:22.480
 the agency in the development of this operation at this precise moment

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.890
 we are studying the possibility of the involvement of the

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:32.390
 in the current goal of creating a

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:39.140
 union central parallel to the united labor movement this is an objective of the

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.370
 Latin American workers' confederation being driven by its

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:48.830
 representative in Puerto Rico - a Cuban exile recently arrived from

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.400
 Venezuela

00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:28.389
 is the state of affairs and here comes what takes flight

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:33.850
 there are other aspects and angles of the chair that we have not been able to cover in a

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:38.710
 activity like this in a presentation like the

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:43.990
 that we have been able to do is also very

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:49.260
 difficult for us to follow every step of the agency is difficult if not impossible

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:55.780
 even for experts, however, I can assure you that when we

00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.340
 we are talking about the activities of the cia in our country we are talking about something

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:06.350
 that we have probably studied very little but that we feel a lot

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:11.859
 That is why all of us who fight for social change in Puerto Rico are

00:34:11.859 --> 00:34:16.730
 constantly in one way or another in contact or colliding with activities

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:23.119
 of the cia we are not in conditions all the time to decipher

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:29.649
 these activities but most of the time we detect them

00:34:30.599 --> 00:34:41.720
 we are pressing those of activision

00:34:56.149 --> 00:35:02.069
 Activision of Sampling the Outside Stepdad

00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:08.309
 level two bases swallowed our current tension by technically locating contact

00:35:08.309 --> 00:35:16.440
 October 9 million votes of the spd October after it does not detect

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.760
 our colonial situation like the colonial situation of any other

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.800
 country in the world is an attack on world peace the activity of the xi in port

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:32.880
 rich to the extent that it represents these attacks on world peace constitutes

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.690
 turn activities against stability

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:42.940
 and of world peace we would like to end our intervention

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:47.840
 deeply thanking the sponsors of this important

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.570
 activity the opportunity that we have been given to offer this presentation

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:57.950
 we are very aware of the importance of the activity

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:02.530
 that we are carrying out today

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:13.970
 if there are reports proposed walker facebook is automatically the
