**MC** [00:00:20] I've been joined by two people who are relevant to this story. If we think in terms of a succession of stations or stages, places where we're standing on solid ground, these two gentlemen are responsible for significant developments which placed us in a place where we had not been before, and which are unambiguous and undeniable.

**MC** Their work as investigators for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, their interviews and interaction with George Joannides who was brought out of retirement to act as an intermediary between the CIA and the pesky Congressional investigation ... investigating the broad daylight murder of a popular sitting President.

**MC** And their authorship of either the Hardway-Lopez Report, or is it the Lopez-Hardway Report?

**Edwin Lopez** It's really the Blakey, the Goldsmith, the Fonzi, Hardway-Lopez report. That's what it is.

**MC** It's my honor to introduce Dan Hardway and Ed Lopez.

**Dan Hardway** Thank you. I am Dan Hardway. I know you would be hard-pressed to tell that I was Dan and this was Ed Lopez by just looking at us. It's always been that way.

**Edwin Lopez** He's the Spanish guy.

**Dan Hardway** I am, but that's a long story for a different forum, and Ed is an honorary hillbilly.

**Dan Hardway** I had the distinct privilege of working for and with ... for Bob Blakey and with Ed Lopez from 1977 to 1978 on the House Select Committee on Assassinations. It was my honor and privilege to be able to assist Ed in preparing the Lopez Report, and to work for Bob.

**Dan Hardway** Ed and I both were students at Cornell and accompanied Bob to D.C. from Cornell, took leaves of absence and worked on the Committee.

**Dan Hardway** I know you're all expecting Bob to be here this morning, and he was supposed to be here this morning. However, he was unable to get here until tomorrow, so he will be appearing tomorrow afternoon.

**Dan Hardway** I do have a statement that is basically a summary of his statement that he was going to make this morning that I've been asked to read on Bob's behalf as part of this presentation. So if you will bear with my reading skills, and I will try to read Bob's statement to you.

**Dan Hardway** The title of it is "The HSCA and CIA: The View From The Top" and it begins ...

**Dan Hardway** In the fall of 1962, the CIA had a problem. The Cuban Missile Crisis had ended with a peaceful resolution. Most Americans had been greatly relieved, but the organization that the CIA considered to be the most single most unpopular Cuban exile organization was very upset with the American government.

**Dan Hardway** That organization was the Revolutionary Student Directory, usually referred to by the initials DRE, representing its Spanish name. The DRE was a direct descendant of a Cuban student group founded in Cuba with the help of CIA agent David Phillips.

**Dan Hardway** The week after the Missile Crises ended, the DRE provided information to the Washington Evening Star newspaper that there still were missiles hidden in Cuba. The story ran with a front page headline. Twelve days later, the Secretary General of the DRE appeared on NBC's "Today" show, where he once again claimed to have seen with his own eyes, nuclear missiles hidden in the caves and hills of Cuba.

**Dan Hardway** Richard Helms was then the Deputy Director of Plans for the CIA. As such, he was in charge of the clandestine services, political warfare, and covert operations. As such, he did not want to lose the Agency's influence with the DRE. Most of the funding for the organization was provided by the CIA, but they were proving to be a difficult organization to control.

**Dan Hardway** Helms summoned the Secretary General of the DRE to Washington for a face-to-face meeting. As a result of that meeting, Helms told the DRE that he would appoint a case officer who would be personally responsible directly to Helms for the work with the DRE.

**Dan Hardway** The officer Helms chose was George Joannides. We know from the limited information that has been released about Mr. Joannides that his work with the DRE was considered to have been very good and successful.

**Dan Hardway** He began working with the group in late 1962. His second specific duty was serving as a case officer for a student project involving political action, propaganda, intelligence collection, and a hemisphere wide apparatus - the DRE.

**Dan Hardway** By January of 1963, he was commended for - quote - resolving complicated problems involving control of this unruly group - close quote.

**Dan Hardway** In July of 1963, his fitness report noted that Joannides "has done an excellent job in the handling of significant student exile groups, which hitherto had successfully resisted any important degree of control." That's a quote, again, from his fitness reports.

**Dan Hardway** He was promoted to take over as head of the political warfare branch of the CIA's Miami station. In other words, he became the manager of the propaganda operations and the only operation that he retained - the only operation, running operation - that he retained under his direct control - was the DRE.

**Dan Hardway** The assassination's record review board released the copies of Joannides' fitness reports that the Agency turned over to them. From the start of his work with the DRE in the fall of 1962, there are quarterly reports until July of 1963.

**Dan Hardway** The next released fitness report is dated May 15th, 1964 and covers the period from April 1st, 1963 to March 31st, 1964. In that time, he has been promoted again to head the covert action branch of the Miami station, while remaining the senior case officer for DRE.

**Dan Hardway** The report praises Joannides for the quality and quantity of his propaganda and political action programs, and his ability to translate policy directives into meaningful actions by all of his assets.

**Dan Hardway** As most of you know, it was in this period of August of 1963 that Lee Harvey Oswald had an encounter with the DRE's representatives in New Orleans. That encounter resulted not only in widespread publicity in New Orleans at the time - including newspaper articles, television coverage, and radio interviews, it also resulted in the first reports trying to tie Lee Harvey Oswald to Castro after the assassination of John Kennedy.

**Dan Hardway** DRE had their information the day of the assassination and it was covered in both the Miami Herald and the Washington Post the next day; headlines in both papers.

**Dan Hardway** The DRE published the details of what they knew in their own paper that week. The CIA never told the Warren Commission about their support of or work with the DRE in 1963. To my knowledge, the CIA never told the Church Committee about it.

**Dan Hardway** The ARRB asked the Agency about DRE at the suggestion of Jeff Morley. The CIA initially told the ARRB the same thing they told me in the HSCA: the Agency had no employee in contact with DRE in 1963.

**Dan Hardway** The ARRB conducted its own examination of CIA and found Joannides personnel file with this clear indication that he was a DRE case officer.

**Dan Hardway** When working as chief counsel for the HSCA, I requested all the agency files on DRE and its members as early as March of 1978. Request included a demand that the agency identify any employees who had, in the period from 1960 to 1964, worked with the DRE.

**Dan Hardway** After that initial request for records, at least two additional requests were made in May and July of 1978. The Agency repeatedly assured the Committee that they had had no contact with the DRE in 1963, having severed all contacts in April of that year.

**Dan Hardway** The leaders of the DRE, in interviews with the Committee's staff, indicated they worked with a CIA case officer in 1963. The Agency assured me that they would search their records and try to identify such an officer.

**Dan Hardway** The Agency employee who contacted me to advise that they could find no record of any such case officer, was George Joannides. He did tell us, however, that he would keep looking.

**Edwin Lopez** And he did.

**Dan Hardway** George Joannides was brought out of retirement by the Agency to specifically work as a liaison with our Committee. He was specifically tasked with dealing mainly with Dan Hardway and Ed Lopez. But he lied directly to me.

**Dan Hardway** A lawsuit by Jeff Morley sought to force the CIA to divulge more of its files on Joannides. In the course of that lawsuit, a sworn affidavit revealed that Joannides was working in an undercover capacity during his time as the liaison to the Committee.

**Dan Hardway** Joannides and the CIA effectively frustrated the HSCA investigation into whether the Agency had any involvement with those who may have had a hand in bringing about the death of John Kennedy.

**Dan Hardway** Had the Agency told the truth about George Joannides he would have been called as a critical witness. He would have been deposed, and he would have likely testified in Executive Session.

**Dan Hardway** If they had not delivered the records, the records would have been subpoenaed. I know that Dan and Eddie believed that he ended any effective investigation that they were undertaking. They complained bitterly at the time about it; at the time I should have listened to them.

**Dan Hardway** That makes me and Eddie feel real good now, but ...

**Edwin Lopez** Forty years later.

**Dan Hardway** Admiral Stansfield Turner, the DCI - the Director of Central Intelligence - in a letter to Chairman Stokes on November 30th, 1978 said, "In the context of addressing problems that Dan and Eddie were causing by not believing that the Agency was cooperating with us - quote - we believe that we have provided you with all the information available to us which is pertinent to your investigation, and hope very much that you can accept this letter as the final assurance of that fact."

**Dan Hardway** At that time I did; I was wrong. I could no longer say with confidence, as the HSCA final report did, that Oswald had no significant relationship with the DRE. At this point, what we know is that the CIA has hidden this information from every investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the assassination

**Dan Hardway** Indeed, they have not just hidden the information; they have lied to at least both the HSCA and the ARRB. I believe that rises to the level of probable violation of law that prohibits impeding the due and proper inquiry of the committees of Congress.

**Dan Hardway** I no longer trust anything that the Agency has told us in regards to the assassination . It lied to the Warren Commission. It lied to the ARRB. It lied to the HSCA.

**Dan Hardway** In admitting that Joannides was employed in a covert capacity as liaison to the HSCA, it has admitted that it violated its charter and ran a domestic covert operation aimed at subverting the HSCA and its investigation.

**Dan Hardway** I do not believe for a minute that records did not exist. They may not now, but they did at one time. Money was involved, and money had to be internally documented, even at the Agency.

**Dan Hardway** That the Agency would put a material witness in a covert capacity as a filter between the Committee staff and the Agency was an outrageous breach of our understanding with the Agency, the Agency's charter and the laws of this country.

**Dan Hardway** As a result, I now believe that we were not able to conduct an appropriate investigation of the CIA. What the Agency did not give us, none but those in the Agency can know for sure. I do not believe any denial offered by the Agency on any point.

**Dan Hardway** The law has long followed the rule that if a person lies to you one point, you may reject all of his testimony. The CIA not only lied, it actively subverted the investigation.

**Dan Hardway** It is time that either Congress or the Justice Department conduct a real investigation of the CIA. Indeed, in my opinion, it is long past time.

**Dan Hardway** That's what Bob was planning on saying if he had opened this session.

**Dan Hardway** I don't have a watch ...

**Edwin Lopez** I'll time you. Dan has a tendency to go off out there, so we'll time him. I'll make sure that he talks for about a half hour, how about that?

**Dan Hardway** I don't want to impede on Ed's time. I want to leave plenty of time for questions, and I certainly don't want to take up John Newman's time, which may be the most significant time here at this whole conference.

**Dan Hardway** But I want to ... I addressed this same issue, which is the HSCA "A View From The Trenches" at the [inaudible 00:14:46] conference last October in Pittsburgh. And I understand that the printed version of my comments on that is going to be available on the AARC website, and that would be aarclibrary-dot-org. And if they're not already up, they'll be up within the next few days and you can download the full text of my comments there.

**Dan Hardway** And I'm not going to cover all that I said there again today. If you want to hear those comments, a video's available at www-dot-historyexhumed-dot-com, front slash, shop, front slash. And I think it's two dollars and ninety-nine cents to download a copy of my presentation if you want a more detailed view on that.

**Dan Hardway** But I talked about what it was like at the Committee to work there and how we got started, how I became involved in it, and what it was like when they brought Joannides in and shut us down.

**Dan Hardway** I talked a little bit about some of the things that we had been working on that we were trying to find out about at the time, and what might have been their motivation for what they did and why they did it.

**Dan Hardway** One of the things that I would like to say right up front is a lot of people have asked me why Bob Blakey believed the CIA, and why he ever accepted that they were cooperating with him?

**Dan Hardway** And I've thought about that, and I want to address that for a minute because we had a hard time - Eddie and I - had a hard time passing our security background checks, and that was really the first battle that Bob fought for us, was to make them give us security clearance.

**Edwin Lopez** For me, it was pretty interesting. Just to tell you ... I grew up in Harlem, and so when the FBI went out to talk to people in my neighborhood, people said they didn't know who I was, because whenever the FBI or the police came by they weren't going to admit that they knew whomever it was they were looking for.

**Edwin Lopez** So Bob had to have me visit New York City, talk to my friends and neighbors, and tell them it was okay to talk to those people in suits.

**Dan Hardway** Well, we won't talk about the other reasons why you had troubles, but ... and I ain't gonna say anything about why I did.

**Dan Hardway** But the thing you have to understand is - and people have asked me this, also - "Well, why do you think the CIA agreed to give you guys unexpurgated access?" I think they seriously underestimated us.

**Dan Hardway** I think they thought they had Bob in their pocket; they thought that me and Eddie were wet behind the ears law school students who would not in a matter of 18 months be able to master anything, or much of anything.

**Dan Hardway** And once we got in there, they assigned clerks ... we had an office at the CIA for about nine months, and we reported to work every morning in Langley. And they would have an escort who would take us from the front of the building into this interior chamber - it had no windows in it - and they would lock us in.

**Dan Hardway** And then our contact would be a CIA employee, initially it was Regis [Blayhut 00:18:06]. And then after Regis got transferred down to the Committee offices, it was two other clerk-type people who would come in and bring us the files that we were asking for.

**Dan Hardway** And the type of access that we had was, we would sit and would read files, and our main brief was Mexico City, but we had Bob's agreement that as long as were getting our work done on Mexico City, we could ask for anything we wanted to.

**Dan Hardway** We were asking for stuff on the [inaudible 00:18:36] War Bill; we were asking for stuff on Bill Harvey, we were asking for stuff on T.J. Nguyen. We were investigating every possibility that we could think of that we'd seen in the critical literature and were trying to do ...

**Dan Hardway** And we were doing all at one time so that there wasn't necessarily a clear pattern that was emerging from what we were asking for. And we weren't required to ask in writing, so there wasn't a permanent record trail of what we were asking for, either.

**Dan Hardway** If you read about when they bring Joannides in, their main justification was to create a paper trail of what we were requesting. And the way it would work is, I would read a file and I'd see a reference to this operation or to this file; I'd tell the clerk I want this file.

**Dan Hardway** And then within a day or two, I would have that file. And I was getting it pretty much, or most of it as far as I could tell, unexpurgated with no deletions, and we were getting great access to great stuff.

**Dan Hardway** And consequently, we told Bob we were happy with that. And initially, the CIA was cooperating. We had no reason to think that they weren't.

**Dan Hardway** When we started pushing - and at this point, I think this was mainly me that started pushing - on investigating the disinformation efforts after the assassination, and realizing that I could tie just about every single disinformation effort directly back to David Phillips, that George Joannides gets involved.

**Dan Hardway** And George Joannides, the first thing he does is he shuts our office in the CIA, and the new arrangement is that we we will work out of the headquarters building of the Committee, and that we will be required to formally request everything we want to see, and that it will be provided to us in a safe room at our headquarters.

**Dan Hardway** And the alleged reason was so that they could keep an accurate record of what we were asking for and what we had seen. What it was, was they were able to slow us down and shut us off from anything really significant that we were looking for.

**Dan Hardway** And I go into some of the details in that, in the presentation that I did in Pittsburgh, which, again, I don't want to repeat because I want to go one step further here today, and I want to offer some views and expand a little bit on ... if you download the written presentation of those Pittsburgh remarks, I'm expanding on what I said in footnote 30 of that paper.

**Dan Hardway** But what I want to talk to you about is, what possibly were they keeping from us? What was it that I had found that they were concerned that I could dig deeper into?

**Dan Hardway** And this was not apparent to me at the time because I didn't know about Joannides. It's only through the work of Jeff Morley and through the work of Dr. John Newman that I've been able to put together what it was that I had that was so significant from their perspective that I didn't see at the time as being as significant as it was.

**Dan Hardway** I knew it was significant, but not near as significant as has become apparent in light of the other facts that have come out.

**Dan Hardway** Here's what we know: David Phillips recruited the leadership of the DRE while he was serving in Havana in the 1950s, and was the DRE's first case officer. At the time it was known as the DER, and it was in Cuba.

**Dan Hardway** When their leadership - when the DRE leadership - fled Cuba in 1960, a guy named William Kent, a case officer in Miami, became the DRE's first case officer in the United States, and organized them into an effective organization.

**Dan Hardway** After moving from Cuba to headquarters, David Phillips became responsible for some of the early disinformation operations aimed at the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He designed the first anti-Fair Play for Cuba Committee operation. That was David Phillips that did that.

**Dan Hardway** During the Bay of Pigs, Phillips was in charge of anti-Castro propaganda operations at headquarters. As such, he worked closely with a guy he called "Doug Gupton at J.M. Wave." Doug Gupton was William Kent.

**Dan Hardway** Phillips described their working relationship as being very close. Gupton wasn't a registered pseudonym, but was rather a cover name that Kent - the officer's true name - used in the field. It is very likely that William Kent - Doug Gupton's registered pseudonym in 1963 - was Robert K. [Trouchard 00:23:52].

**Dan Hardway** Phillips' work on Cuban disinformation continued after his transfer to Mexico City in 1961 until he left Mexico City in 1965. In the fall of 1962, George Joannides was hand picked by Richard Helms - remember Helms promised the secretary general of DRE that he'd have a personal representative. Joannides was hand picked by Helms.

**Dan Hardway** Joannides was part of what was known in the CIA as the Greek mafia that came out of the Greek operations in the late 1940s, and was directly tied into Thomas [Karamasins 00:24:25] and Richard Helms through personal loyalties as well as professional relationships extending back into the late 1940s.

**Dan Hardway** He was hand picked by Helms to replace Ross Crozier as the DRE case officer in Miami after the DRE's public opposition to the policies of the government during the October, 1962, Missile Crisis.

**Dan Hardway** Joannides reported directly to Richard Helms. Joannides' registered pseudonym was Walter D. Newbie. His supervisor was Robert K. Trouchard- William Kent-Doug Gupton, who was very close to David Allan Phillips.

**Dan Hardway** Up to ninety percent of the DRE's funds came from the CIA. The assassination records review board managed to force the CIA to declassify a few of Joannides' reports.

**Dan Hardway** Now I'm not getting into the footnoted information that's in my presentation. This presentation, the written version of it, will be up on the website eventually as well, and you can find the dirty details - as you said, the devil ... was it you, or someone said, "the devil's in the details." Those details will be in the paper.

**Dan Hardway** The AARB managed to force disclosure of his fitness reports as Bob Blakey's presentation said, and on July 31st, 1963, Joannides supervisor, Robert K. Trouchard - who had a very close working relationship with David Phillips - commended Joannides for doing a - quote - an excellent job of handling a significant student exile operation. This stuff Bob covered.

**Dan Hardway** It listed his second specific duty as a case officer for student project involvement, political action, propaganda, intelligence collection, and a hemisphere wide apparatus.

**Dan Hardway** Between August 9th and August 21st, 1963, Oswald became something of a celebrity in New Orleans after his encounter with the local DRE branch, while passing out Fair Play for Cuba Committee pamphlets.

**Dan Hardway** This was Oswald who had organized the one man member Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans at the offices of ...

**Edwin Lopez** Clay Shaw.

**Dan Hardway** ... Guy Bannister and ...

**Dan Hardway** But there were no intelligence connections; this didn't have anything to do with an anti-Fair Play for Cuba Committee propaganda operation, obviously.

**Dan Hardway** And for that, Joannides' quarterly fitness report covering that period is one of the ones that have not been released. And I think they told Jeff Morley that they didn't exist.

**Dan Hardway** At some point between July 31st, 1963 and May 15th, 1964, Joannides replaced Kent as the chief of covert operations at J.M. Wave.

**Dan Hardway** While the scantily released documents on Joannides makes it impossible to determine the time that Kent-Trouchard's references in J.M. Wave's files end after July 25th, 1963. But by early October, 1963 Kent is working at headquarters on one western hemisphere Central America desk. He got promoted.

**Dan Hardway** Where Kent-Trouchard was between the end of July and October 11th, 1963, when we first know that he was headquarters, is not known. Isn't that interesting.

**Dan Hardway** It's reasonable, therefore, to presume that Joannides became the director of covert operations at J.M. Wave replacing Kent-Trouchard sometime between the end of July and the beginning of October of 1963.

**Dan Hardway** As the director, he is said to have had a - quote - distinct flair for political action operations and can translate policy directives into meaningful action programs.

**Dan Hardway** As the director of covert operations, Joannides only retained responsibility for one operation, the student project involving the distribution of printed propaganda, production of radio programs, and the development political action programs.

**Dan Hardway** Well, it sound like what happened with DRE in New Orleans, doesn't it?

**Dan Hardway** On September 16th, 1963 the CIA informed the FBI that it was considering action to counter the activities of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in foreign countries, and that their basis for their plan in foreign countries was the successful operation that had be run in the United States. That was September 16th.

**Dan Hardway** September 17th, Lee Harvey Oswald applied for and received a Mexican travel visa, right after William [Gochet 00:29:07] did, an acknowledged CIA agent.

**Dan Hardway** On September 27th, Oswald arrived in Mexico City. On that day and the following day, Oswald may have visited the Cuban consulate. On those days, the Mexico City CIA station was testing an impulse camera in their photo surveillance operation aimed at the door of the Cuban consulate. It generated 10 feet of 16 millimeter film, which has disappeared.

**Dan Hardway** Sometime in late September, Phillips left Mexico City on temporary duty assignment to headquarters. It is at this time that Phillips is promoted to the chief of anti-Castro operations in Mexico City. Do you see what happened?

**Dan Hardway** Phillips got promoted, Trouchard got promoted, Joannides got promoted, the CIA announced they'd had a successful domestic anti-FPCC operation that they were exporting, the people responsible for the successful program - Phillips, Joannides, William Kent - all just got promoted at the same time. Amazing coincidences in this case.

**Dan Hardway** On October 1st, the Mexico City station sent bulk materials to headquarters by an untraceable transmittal manifest in a diplomatic pouch - quote - to be held in registry until picked up by Michael C. Chodin, that was the registered pseudonym of David Phillips - presently TDY headquarters.

**Dan Hardway** Phillips, when he testified under oath, lied through his teeth about where he was at this time. Suggesting we may know why.

**Dan Hardway** One of the things that I was really pushing on when I got shut down was what was in that pouch? How were pouches handled? How could a pouch be untraceable? How could a transmittal manifest be untraceable? Why does a transmittal manifest have a number if it's untraceable?

**Dan Hardway** But at the time, I had a suspicion that what was in that transmittal manifest - bulk material - was approximately 10 feet of 16 millimeter film showing the front of the Cuban consulate on September 27th and September 28th.

**Dan Hardway** In a self-published book that's very hard to find called "The Silent War Diaries," David Phillips said he monitored the Russian and Cuban reactions to Oswald's visit to the embassys. If he did, he did it from headquarters.

**Dan Hardway** We were not able to find out what was in the pouch. On October 8th, '63 the CIA headquarters sent a cable to Miami advising them that David Phillips would arrive there the following day for a two day visit on his way back to Mexico City.

**Dan Hardway** So he goes down to talk to Joannides. I mean ... let's be reasonable, folks. This is the propaganda operations. Why else is he going to J.M. Wave? This means he would have been back in Mexico City until around October 11th.

**Dan Hardway** So what questions does this raise in my mind? I can ask you what it raises in yours; you'll have to ask yourself that. What are the sum of the inferences that we might draw? And I admit that these are somewhat guesses, but I'm hoping that they are reasonably informed guesses instead of wild speculation.

**Dan Hardway** It appears sometime in the fall of 1963, Trouchard-Kent was promoted from J.M. Wave to headquarters. Joannides was promoted to Trouchard's old position in J.M. Wave. Phillips was promoted to the Cuban desk in Mexico City. Were these rewards for a successful operation?

**Dan Hardway** In August, Lee Harvey Oswald and DRE had their fun in New Orleans. In September, the CIA notified the FBI about exporting their successful but unspecified domestic anti-FPCC operations overseas - the anti-FPCC operations that were originally designed by David Phillips when they began.

**Dan Hardway** The day after the CIA notice, Oswald applies for a Mexico visa in New Orleans, standing in line behind an acknowledged CIA agent. Oswald visits ... Oswald visits the Cuban consulate on September 27th and 28th while the CIA tested an impulse camera photographing the door that he would have used, generating over 10 feet of 16 millimeter film that has disappeared.

**Dan Hardway** There were also reports that Oswald spent time with pro-Castro Mexican citizens and students. Our efforts to find those people and interview them were repeatedly frustrated and blocked by the CIA. I don't mean they didn't cooperate - Eddie will tell you about this on his second trip, I didn't get to go with him because I didn't speak Spanish - to Mexico City.

**Dan Hardway** They went down specifically looking for the students who'd been reported to have been in contact with Oswald, and the CIA actively hid them from our investigators.

**Dan Hardway** They refused to cooperate with us in finding them, they refused to cooperate with us investigating them. They then, when we did it on our own and tried to do it secretly and covertly as best we could as Eddie will explain to you, they actively hid them from us.

**Dan Hardway** Phillips observed the Soviet and Cuban reaction to Oswald's visit, but by October 1st, Phillips' TDY headquarters where the Mexico station send him an untraceable transmittal manifest with unspecified bulk materials to be delivered to him personally and only to him.

**Dan Hardway** From headquarters, Phillips arrived in Miami on October 9th, where he spends two days TDY at J.M. Wave on his way back to Mexico City. Did he meet with Trouchard and Kent at headquarters? Did he meet with Newbie, Joannides in Miami? Did they review the results of the operation and angle of it that they had just run in Mexico City?

**Dan Hardway** Was that the purpose of the meeting, to see whether the domestic operation that had been so successful was going to have success overseas in foreign areas?

**Dan Hardway** Did he meet ... did they review the production from the impulse camera? What was the production ... what was that production of the bulk material in the pouch? We don't know; they were never asked.

**Dan Hardway** George Joannides shut down the HSC investigation into this area. But if you ask me, I've just described to you in outline for an intelligence operation that had both counter intelligence and propaganda purposes.

**Dan Hardway** When we start digging into things a little bit more, we find that Kent was on assignment - William Kent, Robert Trouchard, Doug Gupton - was on assignment in New Orleans in 1967 at the New Orleans CIA office. Doesn't it make you wonder whether maybe Trouchard-Kent was in New Orleans in 1967 to help Garrison and the same way that Joannides helped us?

**Dan Hardway** We don't know from the limited information that we have on that assignment for Doug Gupton - and again, thank you John Newman - we don't know exactly what his position was but we're told that he was undercover.

**Dan Hardway** My conclusion: the CIA has something to hide. Joannides knew what they had to hide. The CIA knew he knew, and knew that we did not know who or what he was or what he was hiding. Joannides hid what they wanted hid. That may just have been the fact that Oswald was used in a CIA operation.

**Dan Hardway** As William Kent's daughter allegedly one told Gaeton, "Oswald was a useful idiot."

**Dan Hardway** And that could have been caused by severe embarrassment, and hence the coverup, possibly. That's the most benign explanation. I do not believe that the more benign explanation of embarrassment over missing him in their embassy coverage can be considered as even remotely possible at this point.

**Dan Hardway** But rather, that is the explanation for just the next layer of a cover story. It still leaves open the much more serious question of rather, at a minimum, the agency through its employees had advanced knowledge of the assassination and did nothing, or even worse, were involved in the conspiracy to kill John Kennedy.

**Edwin Lopez** As always, Danny does a phenomenal job; just a phenomenal job.

**Edwin Lopez** So I've got to tell you, it's great to be here. I haven't seen Dan Hardway in 20 years, and he just looks a little older, has a little less hair.

**Edwin Lopez** When Dan and I first started working on the Committee, I just want you to know, Dan had hair below his shoulders. He and I would go ...

**Dan Hardway** Ed had hair out ...

**Edwin Lopez** ... like an Afro. Dan and I would go to the CIA in flip flops and in shorts, and if I had to do it over again I'd probably do it the same way because we were such assholes.

**Edwin Lopez** But the bottom line, however, is that it made our relationship hard, because they immediately did not trust us, okay? I just have to say that.

**Edwin Lopez** But let me just tell you about Dan. Despite folks believing differently in all my work years, he has been the easiest guy to play with in the sand. Phenomenal work compatriots. I can't say enough about him.

**Edwin Lopez** In addition, I haven't seen Bob in more than 20 years, and Marie Fonzi in 15 plus years. And I've got to tell you, seeing Marie choked me up, and chokes me up as Gaeton - you've heard Dan say it before - was such an important force in my work at the Committee and Dan's work at the Committee and in our work thereafter.

**Edwin Lopez** I can't wait to speak more to Marie. I can't wait to speak to Antonio [Vesiana 00:39:37], whom I spoke to in Florida a couple of times with Gaeton, and whom Gaeton just adored and thought would be the most helpful person to us. So I can't help to talk to him, and I can't wait to talk to others who've continued to fight to solve this assassination.

**Edwin Lopez** Let me tell you a bit about myself. Two years ago, a gent I trained to represent kids against the evil school districts in New York became the superintendent of our Rochester city school district. And he asked me to join them as I had sued the district and its special ed policies, and taken over the department for eight years under a consent decree.

**Edwin Lopez** I joined them as chief counsel two years ago. It's the first time I've worked in a quasi-government job since I worked at the House Select Committee on Assassinations. I constantly want to sue them for what they are doing, and for what I am to correct a change internally. So let me get to the connection.

**Edwin Lopez** I realized that what happened to me at the House Select Committee is happening all over again. After my work at the Senate Committee, I did not want to work in any governmental agency despite being offered numerous jobs; despite Bob Blakey encouraging me to work for [Morganthal 00:40:57]; despite him telling me that I would be come the first Latino Supreme Court justice if I followed what he had prescribed for me.

**Edwin Lopez** I wanted to sue the government, and in fact that's what I did. I went to legal services and sued the government constantly. So, preparing for today made me reflect on that.

**Edwin Lopez** My view from the trenches is just that. It's not going to be a legal analysis. It is my recollection of those 18 or so months on the Committee. It's going to fill in a lot of the details about what Dan started talking about today.

**Edwin Lopez** It's not going to be a legal analysis. It's an idea of what it was like to work at the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and also to work with and against the CIA.

**Edwin Lopez** So how did I get here? There I was at Cornell law school, toiling away working on two chapters for a book that Bob was working on for the Institute on Organized Crime. I had finished a section, gotten it to Bob, Professor Blakey back then, had an appointment to discuss my work with him, and went to see him.

**Edwin Lopez** And he says, "How would you like to help me find out who killed Johnny?" And frankly, I didn't know what the hell he was talking about. I really didn't.

**Edwin Lopez** And so I said, "Excuse me?" And he said, "John F. Kennedy. I've just been named chief counsel for finding out who killed John F. Kennedy." And thus began or would become what I called my wild journey at the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

**Edwin Lopez** Soon, Dan, Leslie Wasserman, Mike Flanagan and myself, all law students, joined Bob in Washington, D.C. And we were true outsiders. There we were in a huge office in D.C., House annex number 2 - the former FBI records building. Ironic, isn't it?

**Edwin Lopez** Just southwest of the Capital, not knowing anybody else on the Committee. Additionally, although I was from New York City, we were basically hicks, at least Dan was. And still is. And we knew no one.

**Edwin Lopez** At first almost no one would speak to us at all. And we overheard staffers talking about "the Munchkins" and wondered whom they were talking about, until it dawned on us that the other ACA staffers were referring to us. We were the Munchkins, especially Leslie and myself ... very short people here.

**Edwin Lopez** So at first I worked on just learning about the case because I had not been following the assassination. I was seven years old when John F. Kennedy had been assassinated, so it was a different era.

**Edwin Lopez** And I read Mark Lane's book and the other tomes of the times. I looked at the Church Committee report, and I looked forward to meeting Gaeton Fonzi because I knew he was working on the Committee.

**Edwin Lopez** I worked on whether Castro had ordered the JFK assassination, following up on a [inaudible 00:43:59] article in The Enquirer, because as Bob said, we have to basically tie things up. Okay? And I wrote a short report for the Committee on that.

**Edwin Lopez** Then we were divvied up into teams, and I became part of team number 3, the anti-Castro team. And I've got to tell you, we were extremely well organized by Bob. I'm not meaning to be too critical of a gent I respect dearly, but we may have been too organized.

**Dan Hardway** Too compartmentalized.

**Edwin Lopez** Definitely. Totally compartmentalized. Bob brought in individuals with backgrounds in prosecuting organized criminals, but with little street smarts. And in fact, I would say almost no street smarts.

**Edwin Lopez** Frankly, at first it was obvious to me that Bob did not think much of the street cops that were there when [Sprague 00:44:51] was there. He viewed his job - and I understand it now that I'm a chief counsel someplace else - but he viewed his job as having to write a report. And he also knew that we only had so much time to do it.

**Edwin Lopez** What I think he forgot is that because he trusted the Agency, they knew that they could wait us out because we were a select committee, not a standing committee, and those are very, very types of committees.

**Dan Hardway** Let me interrupt to finish a thought that I started when I was speaking.

**Dan Hardway** When they started shutting us down and me and Eddie started going to Bob and complaining that we were being cut out, it was hard to convince him because we had had such good access, and we had had such good cooperation. And they had been working consistently on Bob to undermine me and Eddie.

**Dan Hardway** Bob actually, at that point, supported us and when we got a subpoena for stuff - [Proenza 00:45:55]and ... am I allowed to say her name in public?

**Edwin Lopez** Yeah, go ahead.

**Dan Hardway** And we got subpoenas. Bob got subpoenas for stuff we wanted that they refused to give us from the Committee, and he was still backing us at that point. And at that point the CIA started attacking me and Ed to the members of the Committee to try to undercut Bob with the Committee.

**Dan Hardway** And Stansfield Turner actually wrote letters, mainly about the problems at that point that I was causing, to Turner to undercut us with the Committee. And the Committee ended up being the ones that really did not back us as we were pushing for those final bits of information.

**Edwin Lopez** That's absolutely correct. So just taking us back again ...

**Edwin Lopez** There I was at a meeting that Gary had ... Gary Cornwall, who was Bob's guy in charge of the Kennedy assassination ... and all of a sudden Gary says, "So what the hell are those guys down in Miami doing?"

**Edwin Lopez** And I've got to tell you ... I had ... So I said, "Well ..." He says, "One of you guys, call Fonzi and ask him to answer the question in a few words for me, okay? I just want a few words."

**Edwin Lopez** So I've always been a bit of an asshole, and true to form, I raise my hand and said that I could answer the question in five words - trying to solve the case.

**Edwin Lopez** And then he said, "These guys, they're running around all over the place down there and they've never come up with anything that we can resolve in time."

**Edwin Lopez** And once again, there you have the problem with the Committee. We had to resolve things in time, because we were a limited committee in existence, and we were not going to be refunded. And that's just the way it works.

**Edwin Lopez** So that framework of the organization became more and more important, and more and more stymied to what we all had to do. And I was sort of shocked by what Gary had asked because Gaeton had been sending ...

**Edwin Lopez** Gaeton could write, and he wrote prolifically ... and the guy was sending us missives constantly in two sets: regular notes, yellow notes about different things that were going on. He was amazing.

**Edwin Lopez** And I was reading them; Dan was reading them. And so we knew what he was doing. And I assumed that Gary was also. So, just to give you an idea, so let me just recall Gaeton for a minute.

**Edwin Lopez** He would come up to visit and he would stay with Dan and me, and we would spend hours - and I mean hours - discussing our work, conjecturing, analyzing, putting ourselves in the minds of the CIA, in the minds of Committee members, in the minds of the people that we wanted to investigate, because we said if we're going to find out what is going on, we've got to think like them.

**Edwin Lopez** And so we would - over alcohol; we drank a lot of alcohol back then and some other things - we would focus on the investigation and deep into the night. And I mean deep into the night.

**Edwin Lopez** And I remember something that Gaeton told us one time, maybe more than one time. He said, "Buy small tape recorders and dictate your thoughts every night." And all I can say is, "If only ... if only ... if only ..."

**Edwin Lopez** So anyway, the organization that was imposed on us was incredibly strict. We were told to come up with questions for our team that could be fully explored in the next nine months. Fully explored ... the next nine months.

**Edwin Lopez** And I recall a visit from Gaeton soon thereafter, where once again we spent hours in our living room. And he said, "So, what kind of questions should be ask?" And he came up with, "Was there an intelligence agency connection through the anti-Castro Cubans and Oswald to the Kennedy assassination?"

**Edwin Lopez** And I've got to tell you, it's incredible. And I said, "Oh, that's incredible. This is it." And Gaeton, always being the pragmatist, says "They'll never fuckin' accept it at the Committee." And you know what? He was right.

**Edwin Lopez** They didn't accept it because I was being very naïve; because the first thing they said was, "How are we ever going to resolve that issue? Are you nuts? Let's move on."

**Edwin Lopez** So what we wanted to do was look for patterns. We wanted to pursue patterns of verified misinformation. Let me repeat those words - verified misinformation ... almost all linking Oswald to the CIA.

**Edwin Lopez** [inaudible 00:50:56] were born in Miami immediately after the assassination. Many of those linked Oswald to Castro. Misinformation again, okay? Misinformation.

**Edwin Lopez** And all then ... when we started looking at it, being linked back to the CIA. I said, "Dan, so I [inaudible 00:51:13] you before." So we had to set that question, we figured, would also give us the opening to pursue the Antonio Venciana story, since Bishop had asked him to help him develop a phony story through his cousin in Castro's intelligence service.

**Edwin Lopez** We were not nearly as stupid as the CIA thought we were at the beginning, and we were thinking about things, and they figured it out very quickly by the way. It didn't take them too long to figure out what was going on.

**Edwin Lopez** As you know, Gary rejected it. Gary rejected our question, okay? And basically said ... I said to him, "You know, but don't you see? We could get so much closer if we answer this question. So much closer to finding out what happened."

**Edwin Lopez** And Gary's remark - and I remember this to this day - said, "Closer is not good enough. We can't put "closer" into our report, Ed. Closer is not good enough." I'm sure you were there, Dan, and you remember this; it was just incredible.

**Edwin Lopez** So in fact, as everybody here knows now through Al Gonzalez and when I was in Cuba, Fidel called him "El gigante" because he was a big man. "Gigante" means giant. And Gaeton's investigation of the anti-Castro groups in Florida came one of our biggest leads, the David Phillips-Maurice Bishop lead.

**Edwin Lopez** It this lead along with some other groundbreaking work done by Dan, was pretty much on the zone that Blakey decided then to create a Mexico City team. It was created. And through Dan's incredible work.

**Edwin Lopez** And I remember having these long conversations with Dan over dinner and after, about those leads that he had single handedly come up with. And I've got to tell you that as soon as that team was formed, I ran into Bob's office and I said, "I want to work with Dan on this work because this is work that's going to lead down the road. This is what's really important, Mexico City, about this Committee."

**Edwin Lopez** So Dan and I, I've got to tell you, we attacked this area with incredible fervor. I mean, we slept it, we ate it, we drank it, and we ....

**Dan Hardway** And we danced to it.

**Edwin Lopez** ... and it was incredible. We requested countless documents, okay, and we were getting them, as Dan said. And then we started asking about the disinformation after the assassination. And everything changed.

**Edwin Lopez** We were basically told that they were establishing an office within our office for access. We were told that only staffers that now were accorded a super duper top secret security clearance. We had one already, but now this was a super duper one. And only those people could go into that office and read the files we'd be getting. Simple as that.

**Edwin Lopez** They placed a permanent person - a babysitter - in that office. They controlled what we got, how we got it, how we took notes, how we saved notes, and how we even got those notes and access to them later. What do I mean by that?

**Edwin Lopez** The room had a safe with a safe in that safe. We were given pads. We had to date those pads, number those pads, and initial every page we worked on. Any notes taken by Dan or myself had to be placed in an envelope that was dated, and then sealed and handed to the CIA liaison who logged them in with that date.

**Edwin Lopez** Imagine how easy it was then to access those documents ...

**Dan Hardway** And a lot of those documents are missing someway out of there.

**Edwin Lopez** Absolutely. How easy it was to access them later on when we were drafting the report. Just imagine how much longer it took to do that when they knew that we didn't have that much time.

**Edwin Lopez** Again, the stymieing ... and you know, I mentioned before that the report is not the Lopez report. I'll it again, Blakey-Goldsmith-Hardway-Fonzi-Lopez report.

**Edwin Lopez** But I've got to tell you about a few things that happened to us that you will love.

**Edwin Lopez** One time we were cooking dinner for the cultural attache' for Cuba, as they had no Cuban embassy in Washington D.C. And hours before there's a van that says "Standard Industries of America." Funny, S I A instead of CIA. And it appeared down the block.

**Edwin Lopez** And Dan and I were walking around with ... what was her name? Tangie? ... the dog, playing Frisbee out there in our flip flops or bare footed. And we see them just like poised with stuff. And so we run over to talk to them ... we run over to talk to them and brought them coffee, and said, "Hello" and what have you.

**Edwin Lopez** Hours later, because the Cubans were always late, when they showed up to dinner an hour late, lo and behold a guy says, "Oh, let's wave hello to them. They go everywhere we go."

**Edwin Lopez** The next morning ... the next morning, the minute we got in Bob calls us into his office. He had already been contacted by the Agency. They had asked if we had Cubans for dinner; did he know that?

**Edwin Lopez** And Bob was incredibly upset, not because we had Cubans over, but because we did not inform him beforehand so that he could say to them, "Yes I knew, and they had my permission." He says, "Don't ever do that again. I need to be able to say 'yes I know'."

**Edwin Lopez** I know it's ten to 11, so I'm going to wrap up very soon here.

**Edwin Lopez** But I wanted to talk about our trip to Cuba because it was incredible. We had express problems with getting photographs of the people who went into the Cuban embassy, out of the Cuban embassy.

**Edwin Lopez** And we had been asking the CIA forever, and they kept saying we don't have them, doesn't exist, whatever. They had one excuse after another.

**Edwin Lopez** So we mentioned to President Castro that we'd been having major problems getting them. The next day we're there and out comes a book. I said, "Oh, so what's there?" And there were the photos of everyone that went into the Cuban embassy when Lee Harvey Oswald had allegedly visited. And again, as Dan said, allegedly visited, okay?

**Edwin Lopez** Funny, there was no picture of Lee Harvey Oswald, but there were pictures of the CIA photographers that had been taking the photos during that time.

**Dan Hardway** Through the slats.

**Edwin Lopez** Through the slats, exactly. Think about that, right? It gives you an idea of what was going on with the CIA, so you could imagine their surprise when we returned to D.C. and we asked them to verify the veracity of the books that Fidel Castro had given us.

**Edwin Lopez** It boggles the mind. Truth is more weird than fiction when you think about these issues.

**Edwin Lopez** So we asked the CIA about giving access to the photographers. And of course, they refused, but the one person that we got to see, even though we had already seen photos from the slats, we basically had to interview through ... in a hotel room, through a sound system.

**Edwin Lopez** We were in separate rooms, voice recognition on so that we could not recognize any voices, et cetera, so we could ask the questions. That's how we talked to one person. Think about the kind of BS that was going on back then.

**Random voice** Did you just say [inaudible 00:59:33]?

**Edwin Lopez** Ah ha. Did you say that there was some mechanism that works so that the person in the other room whom you could not see, their voice was distorted so you would not recognize?

**Edwin Lopez** So for all we know, it was Paul Winchell or somebody doing everybody's voices?

**Edwin Lopez** It could have been anybody. It could have been David Phillips. Joannides. Who knows? We just don't know.

**Edwin Lopez** But I've got to tell you, we had some incredible occurrences. Dan, you'll remember, when we were reading files from the CIA and we'd find things that we never should have been given, people had not looked at that stuff carefully.

**Edwin Lopez** And at one point, we found out the names of people who had been at the Cuban embassy, who also happened to have been double agents with the CIA. And so we asked for access for them. They're like, "Where did you get those names?"

**Edwin Lopez** It's like, "Well, in this document." And they're like ... I'm sure somebody got fired that evening. Pure and simple.

**Edwin Lopez** I know people got brought out of retirement.

**Edwin Lopez** Exactly where I was going. So we asked the CIA for access to them, and to the students that Oswald had met with. And they denied us, so we had to go up the chain. And again, this takes time going up the chain. We would ask the next person up, denied; next person up, denied.

**Edwin Lopez** Finally, Bob Blakey and Louie Stokes went to see Stansfield Turner at the CIA directly. And denied. So they came back to the office and Stokes goes away, and Bob Blakey calls me in - and this is Bob Blakey at his best.

**Edwin Lopez** He says, "So ..." gives me the information, he says, "So what did Stansfield Turner say?" I said "That they will not make these people available to us." He said, "Did they say anything about us being able to go out and find them?"

**Edwin Lopez** And so, all of a sudden I was on a plane to Mexico with a guy named Papi - I call him Papi, I don't know if I should give his real name - who ... Harold Leap is his name ... who had been a DEA agent whom Bob knew well, and I was brought in basically, like, in handcuffs as an informant of a DEA agent so that I could get in there.

**Edwin Lopez** We told no one we were going there. No one.

**Edwin Lopez** You told everyone you was on vacation. That was the ... Bob said, "You're on vacation. If they find out, I know nothing." It was like Schultz, "I see nothing, I hear nothing," pure and simple.

**Edwin Lopez** So we did go down there, and Dan's already told you, that ... I don't know how they found out, except of course, I think our phones were bugged, our place was bugged ...

**Edwin Lopez** But to make a very long story short, we did talk to one person, and then everybody else disappeared.

**Edwin Lopez** So we went up and did some other work, and talked to the deputy chief of operations staff at Mexico City station, and then came back looking for others. It was incredible.

**Edwin Lopez** But look, I could go on forever recounting stories about our struggles to get the work done, but I want to provide you some time to ask questions of Dan and myself, so I'm going to stop.

**Edwin Lopez** I will tell you, because I'm a lawyer and lawyers always love to continue talking and always have a few more words to say, that Jim Lazar is doing an incredible job in trying to get access to these important documents.

**Edwin Lopez** Because these are the documents that will allow us to find out how our investigation was stymied, and also to learn more about exactly what happened with respect to the assassination. Times are passing, folks. We've lost Mike Goldsmith, Al Gonzalez, and Gaeton Fonzi. A lot of talent and memories.

**Edwin Lopez** Let's make sure that while those of are alive who did the work, and those of you out there who are doing the work, that we rally around Jim and the work that he's doing to get the documents that we need to solve this mess.

**David Kaiser** David Kaiser, I'm the author of "The Road To Dallas." I have an addendum to Mr. Hardway's presentation that he may or may not want to comment on, and I have a question for Mr. Lopez.

**David Kaiser** The addendum is this: it has to do with CIA files. There is now at [NEROF 01:04:26]thanks to the Board and the CIA printed microfilm collection, a file on the DRE in which you follow Joannides' relations with them through the second half of 1963 on some matters, particularly the DRE's desire to set up a paramilitary camp, which you'd turned them down.

**David Kaiser** And in fact, to be quite frank, you can't read ... and that file, by the way, also goes back to '62 ... the whole story of how basically they fired their own case officer and got him replaced through Helms = and they were lying about that, and they wouldn't let you have that.

**David Kaiser** But what is fascinating to me is, there's nothing in that file that they couldn't have survived. So if they're trying to hide something, it's something else, which is one of their tactics. So I'm fascinated by that.

**David Kaiser** Mr. Lopez, I know you have generously shared the credit, but I'm going to treat the Lopez report as your report. And I loved it and I felt this man is a kindred spirit because you were so careful, so sure not to go beyond exactly what the facts said in all these complicated issues about Oswald and Mexico City, and frankly that's the way I am, too.

**David Kaiser** And when I reread a little of "The Road to Dallas," or of any of my other books, I often find myself saying to myself, "David, why were you so careful there? I mean, the evidence is really stronger than you made it out to be. You could have gone further."

**David Kaiser** And I want to ask you - I don't know when the last time you read the report was - but are there things in the Lopez report that you feel that way about when you look at them now? I have no idea what they might be, that "Gee, we really could have been a good deal stronger there than we were."

**Edwin Lopez** I'm [audio dropout 01:06:17] also provide his answer, because really we did this work together. But there were times Ed had more conclusions and more of my opinion in there, and then Mike Goldsmith, when he did the final edit, sort of like scaled it back.

**Edwin Lopez** And so I can't take credit, okay, because credit is not due there. I think at times I said more and Mike ... Mickey Goldsmith, when he was doing the final rewrites, just scaled them back, and said, "We've got to be more careful." We'd spend a lot of time talking about it. And so that's how I feel.

**Edwin Lopez** The other thing is that we also knew that it was going to be presented to the CIA and we wanted it to be accepted. We wanted it to be released.

**Edwin Lopez** And so imagine our surprise when we got to the CIA and we have what we feel is a good document that was measured, really measured, and yet we couldn't get past the first page then in two hours ... in two hours, because they wanted to make it like Swiss cheese.

**Edwin Lopez** So that's my answer. Dan?

**Dan Hardway** That's an interesting thing, because that's highly relevant to today, to what's going on with the Senate report. They did the very same thing to us.

**Dan Hardway** Eddie's report - the Lopez report - was written to be part of the final report. That is a draft section of the final report of the Committee that never got released because the CIA did the same thing that they're now doing to the Senate Intelligence report.

**Dan Hardway** But, I want to point out to you, if you know anything about how Senate rules operate, resolutions, Senate resolution 400 that created the Senate Intelligence Committee, gives the Senate Intelligence Committee the right to declassify anything that they determine should be declassified.

**Edwin Lopez** If they have the guts.

**Dan Hardway** But that raises the question, why is there all this to do about declassifying and publishing this report unless the Senate itself is too afraid of the CIA? Now, that was the subject of another paper that I'm working on that someday I may get to present somewhere, but that's the same thing.

**Dan Hardway** But yeah, the report we thought was measured, we thought it was very reasonable, we thought it was it very accurate in assessing the records that we had available to us and raising questions that should have been raised.

**Dan Hardway** But did we have more information? We had stronger opinions, but they were opinions, and we weren't writing an opinion piece. We were trying to write a summary of what we found.

**Edwin Lopez** And the one that was published back then ...

**Dan Hardway** By the way, there will be more directly relevant information in my talk tomorrow to some of what you said.

**MC** Gentlemen, we've got a very, very limited amount of time. Ladies and gentlemen, and we want to have everyone have an opportunity to speak to our guests.

**MC** I'm aware ... I don't want to do a breach of protocol, but I'm aware that Malcolm Blunt has to leave within the next hour or so, and I wonder if we could, as a courtesy to Malcolm, just let Malcolm as a question very briefly and then we will continue right up as close as we can to the point at which Dr. Newman will give his talk.

**Malcolm Blunt** You guys have done a tremendous job because 36 bucks is of your notes at [NARA 01:09:41], I use all the time. I go backwards and forwards in those, and I know the Agency struggled with the decision to actually let those go.

**Malcolm Blunt** There was a guy in a historical review group called Frank Most, a long time ... he was a career agent, and he said ... he gave a recommendation that a lot of that stuff should never be released. But it's released, and it's tremendous stuff.

**Malcolm Blunt** And on to the pouch, when you talked about the pouch that was sent into Record Integration division, you can't exclude it. There's a system within the Record Integration division where you can get stuff stamped at the executive office, and it says on that stamp "To be excluded from the Record Integration division."

**Malcolm Blunt** So it can go to the Record Integration division, but be hidden.

**Dan Hardway** That was one of the things that I was really pushing, both the CIA and was trying to get the people that worked with State, to find out about what kind of records were kept on those pouches, how they were handled.

**Dan Hardway** The fact that the transmittal manifest had a number on it indicated to me that there was some way to trace the stupid thing.

**Malcolm Blunt** It's another part of the record. It's very opaque ...

**Dan Hardway** Right. It doesn't go into the official records, but you're never going to convince me that someone does not have a record of where that thing went.

**Malcolm Blunt** That stuff is stamped.

**Edwin Lopez** And in fact ... here's the thing. We were often told by some CIA intelligence officers that give us information that they had files that, if they don't want a number, there is no number. Simple as that.

**Edwin Lopez** There is no transmittal number. There's nothing. It's just for their eyes only, being held by, let's say, William Harvey, in his desk in a little cabinet that only he gets a chance to see and nobody else

**Dan Hardway** [Doulus 01:11:37] told the Warren Commission the same thing. Doulus told the Warren Commission we can never determine whether someone was actually an agent because the only way that some agents are ever verified is in the personal files of the guy that's actually running the agent.

**Edwin Lopez** And it's nowhere else.

**Dan Hardway** And he said there may only be a hieroglyphic and a note that indicates who the agent is, which explains a lot of the mystery about Mr. Vessiana's testimony and why they can insist that there's no record there ... if there, in fact, is not a record there because we have found that they consistently lie in this area.

**MC** If we could move to the next question, go ahead.

**Paul Kunsler** Paul Kunsler of Washington, D.C. My question's directed to Dan Hardway.

**Paul Kunsler** There's a great deal of debate in the research community whether Lee Harvey Oswald actually did go to Mexico City in September of 1963. Many people say no. You suggested this morning that he did.

**Dan Hardway** We did not specifically look at whether or not Oswald actually went. Our conclusion in the Lopez report was that it was very likely that an imposter at least made some of the phone calls, if not some of the visits ... or both.

**Dan Hardway** Looking back on that, I'm no longer certain of that conclusion either. And the reason that I'm no longer certain of that conclusion is because of Annie Goodpasture's involvement with Bill Harvey and the ...

**Edwin Lopez** [inaudible 01:13:17]

**Dan Hardway** ... and the fact that Harvey had a lot of personal loyalty for the people that were involved in the electronic intercepts operations, which is an operation in the CIA that he had founded and started and recruited the agents for.

**Dan Hardway** I'm not at all certain that there were actually even phone calls that were made by the imposter. I'm not at all certain that the faking of those didn't happen at the transcript level, and there were fake transcripts inserted.

**Edwin Lopez** And when we thought about those things, we used to feel like we were paranoid schizophrenics thinking about this. Because like, how could that actually be that way, right Dan?

**Dan Hardway** And then you met Annie Goodpasture and you figured out how it could be that way.

**MC** Thank you for you question, Paul. Thank you for your question.

**Jerry Polokov** Jerry Polokov with the AARC. I don't actually have a question. I'm just listening to you guys. You have such an important story to tell, and I would beg you, both of you, to write a book, do a ...

**Jerry Polokov** This has to be ... we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg, and you've got to do an oral history and you've write a book because this needs to get out there. It's so important. And thank you for coming.

**Edwin Lopez** If only ... again, if only we had listened to Gaeton. Now Dan did write me recently, and let me say to everybody, that if we ever got our act together, or as he put it shit together, and did anything, we would have to call the book or the screenplay "Talking Heads Clash."

**Edwin Lopez** We loved Talking Heads; we loved The Clash. But of course, think about the irony. Talking Heads. Clash, because that's what we went through with the Committee and et cetera.

**Dan Hardway** Those two bands pretty much provided the soundtrack for mine and Ed's work. We used to show up at the CIA at 7:30 in the morning with Talking Heads or The Clash blaring as loudly as we could out of the speakers in our vehicle as we would roll up to the CIA with hair below our shoulders or [inaudible 01:15:28].

**Edwin Lopez** There come the freaks again.

**Dan Hardway** They thought we were immature ...

**Edwin Lopez** ... and stupid. Go ahead.

**David Scheim** David Scheim, author of "Contract on America." It's a total pleasure to hear you speak about these reminiscences. I just ... briefly Burt Griffin told me the same thing about the Warren Commission. He was looking into Ruby, but was initially given four months to wrap the whole thing up, so ... constrained from the start.

**David Scheim** I just want to ... first question is, will Blakey's statement be on the record available?

**Dan Hardway** Yes, it'll be made available on the AARC website. Plus Bob will be here tomorrow afternoon.

**David Scheim** Okay, because that's an ... it's quite amazing. Thank you.

**Edwin Lopez** And he's spending a half hour to 40 minutes answering questions.

**MC** Jim?

**David Scheim** I just wanted to say one other thing very briefly, that I'm just wondering if you look at Tampa and Chicago, patsys and assassination attempts that were thwarted, and then Oswald set up as a patsy.

**David Scheim** But someone who you'd set up as a patsy in those days of underworld, anti-Castro, Mafia, CIA, perhaps by mistake they got someone who had links to a lot of embarrassing things.

**David Scheim** I'm wondering if in some sense, too much focus on Oswald ... it will get you in places they don't want to see you, but I'm wondering it could be a distraction if we're following their agenda.

**Dan Hardway** Just let me answer that. That's one of the things that I thought about and I've talked to Dr. Newman about, is the Agency has a penchant for running operations within operations. There's layers, and then there's layer of cover stories, and then there's of deniability.

**Dan Hardway** And I think that it's entirely possible and entirely potentially credible that David Atley Phillips thought he was running a simple disinformation, di-angle operation and had no clue about what was being planned in Dallas.

**Dan Hardway** I think it's entirely possible ...

**David Scheim** Something could have been piggy backed.

**Dan Hardway** I think it's entirely possible ...

**Edwin Lopez** Compartmentalization.

**Dan Hardway** ... it's entirely possible that not only did Oswald find out that he was a patsy on November 22nd, David Atley Phillips found out that he had been using the person who was accused of assassinating the President, and on November 22nd he was presented with a brief, "Now tie this to Castro."

**MC** Jim, go ahead.

**Jim** I have two questions. [inaudible 01:18:05]

**Jim** Hey Eddie, on your book, put his name first, okay?

**Edwin Lopez** The Hardway Book.

**Jim** First for Danny, you were saying earlier ... I guess you were saying there were more students than just Kontraris who this Oswald guy actually met with?

**Dan Hardway** Well, Kontraris says there was a whole group of them. We were trying to find out who they were and interview ...

**Jim** But you couldn't find them?

**Dan Hardway** ... we couldn't find them. They kept us away from just about everybody we wanted to talk to on that second trip to Mexico.

**Jim** And Eddie, I talked to you about this once before. Have you read Shannon's book?

**Edwin Lopez** Sheenan. Yeah.

**Jim** Do you think [Elena DeCarol 01:18:53] DePas is a disinformation agent?

**Edwin Lopez** No. Elena was a ... I was supposed to go visit her in Spain. That's where she was and we actually had the ticket already bought.

**Dan Hardway** [inaudible 01:19:07]

**Edwin Lopez** Because we had said we'll bring her over, but Elena was a very unstable person. And so ...

**Dan Hardway** Or so we're told.

**Edwin Lopez** ... or so we're told. But I spent a lot of time talking to her on the telephone, and she kept saying, "Yes, come over. I've got so much to talk to you about, blah, blah, blah." And then "No, I can't talk, and yes, come over."

**Edwin Lopez** And so I don't know whether it was instability, or it was that she was being frightened by someone, or that she was frightened herself. But ultimately, we had ... I had tickets to go there, we had bought tickets for her to come to us, and neither of them worked out.

**MC** We've got about two minutes. Professor Mellon?

**Prof. Mellon** Thank you. Gaeton Fonzi, when I was doing my book, said the one person I should talk to you from the Committee is sitting up there, Eddie Lopez.

**Prof. Mellon** So Eddie Lopez, this is what I wanted to ask you from a long time. When Bernado DeTorres was briefed by the CIA before the Committee questioned him, what were the strictures that CIA put on what could be asked Bernado DeTorres?

**Edwin Lopez** I would be lying to you if I remembered, but we were given specific time periods which we could not ask him questions about. And it was not just the CIA that came in to talk to Bob; it was the CIA, the FBI and one other agency, and each of them said "you cannot talk about this time period. You cannot talk about that time period."

**Edwin Lopez** So by the end, when Mike Goldsmith and myself were sitting there, and there's one other person ... I forget his name, Bill something or other ... we were sitting there preparing to question them ... Chuck Burt.

**Edwin Lopez** We're like sitting there, we're saying "Well, what do we ask them about because there's nothing left?" It's like, "Oh, how was your drive over here?"

**Prof. Mellon** I just want to mention what Gaeton Fonzi said - I think it may even be in his book - and that is he was sitting there listening, and after listening to that he wondered, he said "Anybody who's listening to this would wonder why, of all the thousands of Cubans in Miami, they chose this guy to bring up."

**Edwin Lopez** Because he's a nice guy.

**MC** Last question, Doctor Mantick?

**Dr. Mantick** This is a simple yes or no answer. David Mantick from Jerry Ford's hometown.

**Dr. Mantick** Go back in time five or ten years, would you have predicted then that you could ... that Blakey would have made the statement that you were at ...?

**Dan Hardway** That's a good question. I've always believed that he would eventually come around.

**MC** Nice. And on that, Ed do you want to add?

**Edwin Lopez** No, no. I think ... I agree with Dan. I knew Bob would eventually come around. And so it's a matter ... we were in ... we were so invested and so heavily involved in it, and Bob was up above everybody.

**Edwin Lopez** It was like ... like, you know, that umbrella group and he's looking at the whole thing. And he doesn't have the time to look and spend the hours that we needed to spend doing things. I'm going to just give you an example.

**Edwin Lopez** I worked with both Vince Bugliosi and with Jerry Spence on the Showtime special on Lee Harvey Oswald trial. And Bob, in some ways, was the way that Jerry Spence looked at the trial.

**Edwin Lopez** He asked me a question and I'm giving him all this detail, and he looks at me and he says, "Eddie, Eddie, Eddie ... this is fucking television. Say it to me in 30 words or less."

**Edwin Lopez** And Bob was the same way. He had so much on his mind, he just wanted you to get to the point, "how's it going to be in the report? How will it look?" and then move forward at that time.

**Dan Hardway** Just let me add, maybe, as the final comment and Bob, I'm sure, is more than able to handle himself and answer any questions.

**Dan Hardway** But just let me say that the reason why I always remained confident that he would eventually come around is because, in my opinion, he is a man of incredible integrity. And I think Eddie will back me up on that.

**Edwin Lopez** A hundred percent.

**MC** Thank you gentlemen.
