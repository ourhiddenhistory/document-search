**James Abourezk** Well, what is happening is that the US taxpayers' money is going to support dictatorships, repressive regimes throughout the world. And this US tax money is being used to imprison people, not because they're criminals but because they happen to oppose the government in power in most of these countries. US tax money is being used to torture these people to prevent them from being politically active. I think foreign aid ought to be used for humanitarian purposes but not for military aid, nor should be used to support and prop up military dictatorships that undertake this kind of repressive action. That is, imprisoning their own people and torturing them simply for political dissent, political disagreement.

**Tim McGovern** That was Senator James Abourezk, one of too few members of Congress who strongly believes that US tax money should not be used for the funding of torture, either direct or indirect.

**Tim McGovern** This is Tim McGovern with Taxes for Torture. For the next 60 minutes, we will examine the vast program of counterinsurgency activities in the Western Hemisphere that the United States has developed over the years. By discussing these activities in sanitized language, minimizing their importance, the US government has kept most elements of this program out of public consciousness and relatively invulnerable to criticism. This counterinsurgency network has been called a first line of defense and is capable of controlling situations that would otherwise destabilize repressive governments in Latin America that are under US control.

**Tim McGovern** It's made up of groups like the Green Berets and Latin American military and police forces who have been developed, trained, equipped, and indoctrinated by the Office of Public Safety, which works out of the Agency for International Development. Senate hearings on the so-called public safety programs culminated with this conclusion by a staff assistant at the Senate Committee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. Pat M. Holt said, quote, "The United States is politically identified with police terrorism. Political terrorism has become a necessary tool in keeping pro-US government in power throughout the Third World."

**Tim McGovern** For some background on AID's Public Safety programs, we go to Michael Klare. He's a staff member of the North American Congress on Latin America and author of the book "War Without End: American Planning for the Next Vietnam". Michael Klare.

**Michael Klare** AID had two programs. One of them was a public safety program, the other is the International Police Academy. And the public safety program was the massive program of training police all over the world in their own country. As well as arming them and advising them and giving them money. It also runs the International Police Academy in Washington, DC. In 1961, AID set up a bureau inside AID called the Office of Public Safety or OPS, which had the specific function of providing assistance to police departments in undeveloped countries, third-world countries. And this agency, OPS, was tasked with the job of providing training in those countries by sending Public Safety Advisors, that was their official title, capital letters, Public Safety Advisors to each country to provide training on the spot to people there and to advise the police chiefs and the police commanders in each of those countries directly.

**Michael Klare** It was also set up to provide equipment like riot control equipment and computers and weapons to police departments in those countries. And to administer the International Police Academy in Washington DC. At the height of the program in 1970, there were four hundred Public Safety Advisors scattered around the world, including about two hundred in South Vietnam and about 10 each in each Latin American country.

**Timothy Harding** Police advisors are primarily involved in Latin America and shoring up the counterinsurgency potential of the police forces.

**Tim McGovern** Latin American history professor Timothy Harding, California State University, Los Angeles.

**Timothy Harding** There have been dramatic instances of that which the movie State of Siege for instance has made about Dan Mitrione, who was first in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where he was advisor to the most vicious, at that time, center for torturing political prisoners. Then he was moved from Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais, Brazil to Uruguay, where he advised on the tactic against the Tupamaros in Uruguay. And in that zone, has kidnapping and finding the stories made available to the American public in the form of the movie State of Siege.

**Michael Klare** The US was also training people to set up police academies in those countries, and then we would provide teachers for those schools as well. So that even though the International Police Academy has only trained about four thousand top police officials, the public safety program as a whole claims to have provided training to over a million foreign policemen.

**Tim McGovern** The International Police Academy provides training to only the highest ranking police officials of foreign countries. Courses are offered by the US Treasury Department, the post office. Border patrolling is taught by the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, and the FBI offers a field trip to their crime lab. Another excursion takes the students to the CIA Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Michael Klare listed some other training provided at the International Police Academy.

**Michael Klare** Programs ranged from ordinary so-called police work like traffic management and all that kind of stuff, up into and including intelligence work, counterinsurgency. They have a program to train police how to make bombs and how to use assassination weapons. They train them in investigation of mail. There have been courses in prison management. Every aspect of police work, emphasis being on counterinsurgency, intelligence work, counter-guerilla operations, sort of the political side of police work.

**Tim McGovern** Public safety program, as police aid to most Latin American countries, even those that do not at the moment have political dictatorships. And the public safety program, officially tries to disguise the counterinsurgency nature of that program. They emphasize it's nothing but teaching people how to direct traffic. The insulting thing about that is that the United States should even pretend that they have to go down to another Latin American country to teach somebody to control traffic, as if the people were so dumb they couldn't figure out how to do that for themselves.

**Tim McGovern** What they really do help them with is the computerization of police activities, and the primary justification for the massive amounts of money put into police aid is certainly not because parking is snarled up in downtown Rio de Janeiro. It is only justified in terms of its counterinsurgency role.

**Michael Klare** One of the people who went through the training is the Director of SAVAK, S-A-V-A-K, in Iran, which is the secret police force working directly beneath the Shah of Iran, which is known to have murdered 60 political activists in the past few years, as well as torturing many hundreds of others. That man was trained at the International Police Academy. Of many of the leaders of the Carabineros of Chile, which is the paramilitary national police force, were trained there. The Director of Intelligence and Security of the government of Costa Rica, the Chief of the Police in the Dominican Republic was trained at the International Police Academy. And the police in the Dominican Republic are also have been cited for their barbaric practices including assassination of anti-government leaders, and all kinds of repression and brutality.

**Quinn Tamm** I feel like the International Police Academy serves a very definite need for those countries that are not able to provide satisfactory training for their police forces. And the elimination of it eliminates a service which the United States can render to countries that are not capable of this type of training.

**Tim McGovern** Quinn Tamm, head of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

**Quinn Tamm** I think that it is also an excellent public relations or friendly gesture towards the people, especially of those countries that take part in the International Police Academy. This also, the purpose of creating goodwill among law enforcement agencies throughout the world.

**Michael Klare** And everybody will be happy. The real reason, so far as I could see, is to suppress radical and revolutionary political movements at a very early stage in the development, so that a large revolutionary movement doesn't develop and threaten the planned governments that the United States has installed in most of these countries. As once you have a full scale revolutionary movement, like you do in Vietnam, nothing is going to save the client except intervention by the United States with regular troops. And this is something that United States just cannot afford at this time. It cannot afford it economically and it cannot afford it politically. So, by building up local police forces as a first line of defense against insurrection and rebellion, the White House, the government hopes to make it unnecessary for US troops to intervene abroad to save right-wing governments that it's set up there.

**Timothy Harding** The police and military aid given to Latin America by the US government comes out of our taxes. And most people in the United States are not aware that the money that is collected from them is going to support repressive regimes in those literal sense, actually to support the repression itself.

**Timothy Harding** The training of the torturers, the equipping of them, and the sophisticated equipment that they use in their counterinsurgency activities. I'm talking about computer that can be hooked up to wiretaps of telephones throughout the country. So if there's a computerized monitoring of telephone calls throughout the country to detect conversations that might be related to guerilla activity. And the processing of nearly the entire population through computer banks to identify those people, who by various characteristics can be shown to be more likely to be susceptible to revolutionary activity. You know, maybe they belong to a union and their mother was this, and they've been through this grade of education and read such and such books and so on. Then the police begins to process this group of high likelihood, one-by-one. They call them in and question them, they put police agents on their tail and so on.

**Timothy Harding** And all these highly sophisticated techniques are made available to otherwise underdeveloped countries by United States money and United States technically. And we're paying for this and the people of the United States should become aware of how their money is spent so that they can hold their own government into account and say whether or not this is the way want the money to be spent.

**Tim McGovern** The fact is that our tax money is being spent on aid to repressive regimes. The question now is why? Why would it be advantageous to the United States to keep in power governments that imprison and torture their populace simply for political disagreement? To date, according to government figures, the United States has put approximately 100 million dollars worth of military aid in South America, apparently the aim of crushing the guerrilla movements there. Why's the United States so concerned with these revolutionaries? We asked Michael Klare.

**Michael Klare** So the whole US free world system, so-called, the capitalist system on a global basis depends on having unlimited access to markets and raw material sources in all of these countries. That the system as a whole, can't survive without access to most of the Third World. And revolutionary movement which would take power and set up its own priorities for its use of its natural resources, would threaten the prosperity and the functioning of the US world system.

**Michael Fleet** Latin America matters to us because it is our sole or our major source or supply of certain key strategic raw materials: manganese, copper, tin, and others.

**Tim McGovern** International relations and political science professor Michael Fleet, University of Southern California.

**Michael Fleet** It is also important to us because of its growing population size, therefore, its capacity to absorb excess domestic production that the United States economic system inevitably produces. We need outlets for that excess production. Well in addition to this general need then that Latin America satisfies of the US economy as a whole, it is also an extremely important economic resource for individual economic companies, corporations. Multi-national corporations based in the United States for example, in many instances draw on Latin America for more than 50% of their overall revenues.

**James Abourezk** Low wages, some kind of government stability, whether its repressive or not, they don't care, is profitable to them and they want to keep it that way.

**Tim McGovern** South Dakota's Democratic Senator, James Abourezk.

**James Abourezk** Multi-national corporations based in this country have always had a large voice in US foreign policy. That kind of foreign policy is against the interests of the majority of the people of the United States.

**Michael Fleet** Latin America absorbs in profitable investment in the neighborhood of 18 billion dollars a year. Which is an appreciable amount of money and underlies the economic importance Latin America has to the United States. In addition to this economic importance there is this strategic or the military importance. And that I think is perhaps best characterized by referring to the traditional Monroe Doctrine of the United States has pursued with respect to Latin America.

**Michael Fleet** The declaration was made in the first part of the 19th century and it said essentially the United States would regard as a direct threat to its own integrity any attempt by a European power to gain a foothold in the Western Hemisphere. We want to keep Latin America free from penetration by our international rivals. We regard it as our sphere of influence, it's as important to us for the economic reasons I described, and for military reasons as well. You can mention such things as the Panama Canal, and the control to the South Pacific and so forth. And in this regard, it is important for us to have in control of the economic and political policy making processes throughout the continent in the various countries, people whom are sympathetic to our views, share our perspectives on a global military or strategic level, and who are willing to continue to supply us with the materials, the raw materials we need at the prices that we are prepared to pay, who are willing to continue to afford us access to their domestic market for this excess production we have problems getting rid of from time to time.

**James Abourezk** In other words they're pretty receptive to suggestions from our State Department. Any non-aligned country or any popular government of course is going to be independent from 100% of the wishes of our State Department. So therefore, it's in the interest of probably of our high administration officials to have these governments there who will listen to them and who are dependent on them.

**Michael Fleet** Today we prop up governments that are themselves economically weak and enhance their political strength in the process. And they similarly prop up governments that are military weak, that is weak in the maintaining of its internal security and stability.

**Michael Klare** Decent policing in the Third World is helpful to the development of stable economic and social institutions.

**Michael Fleet** This is particularly true of conservative governments that are opposed strongly by working class organizations, peasant organizations, or the civilian political establishments generally. Economic aid that is administered by the United States under very clearly discriminatory criteria, where aid is given to those governments who will comply with US policy. The long-term system for support for the government in question may well be much more substantial in the impact.

**Timothy Harding** With the United States support they don't need any internal support. They can have a very narrow popular base, that's enough to sustain them power, if their foreign debts are paid for them by loans, if their military equipment is donated, if their sophisticated equipment to be able to block the opposition movements has made available and how to use it is made available by the United States.

**Michael Fleet** To those governments which are under more direct and immediate assault or attack or opposition from the outside, we can still offer direct military aid in the form of equipment to the police and paramilitary equipment.

**Michael Klare** In Chile, the Department of Defense provides aid to the Chilean Defense Ministry, which includes the Carabinero, the paramilitary police force which was involved in the coup.

**Charles Wiggins** Allende was appropriating emergent properties in that country.

**Tim McGovern** California's Republican Congressman, Charles Wiggins.

**Charles Wiggins** ... and financial American invests were in jeopardy, that's a concern to this country and I'm personally more satisfied that the present government is more friendly to the United States then the Allende government.

**Michael Fleet** In some instances this military assistance takes the form of sophisticated torture equipment, a variety of different kinds of weapons, bombs, anti-personnel guns. Things like this that are to be used discreetly and distantly by the national police force or by the military of the particular country. There's also of course the more visible kind of military aid, that is the supply of the more conventional sorts of weapons, airplanes, credit for the purchases of conventional guns and things like that.

**Michael Fleet** In this general area of military aid, which clearly strengthens the hand of repressive governments in Latin America should be noted that the level of aid, something that the amount of aid channeled through official sources has declined in recent years.

**Tim McGovern** Professor Fleet was talking about aid that was officially recorded. But there are factions of our government whose activities aren't always recorded, let alone officially. John Marks, co-author of "CIA, Cult of Intelligence", gave example at a Congressional Hearing.

**John Marks** Now the CIA specializes in having 'clean arms', arms that can't be traced. There's a company over here in Alexandria called Inner Arms Corp, which is the largest private arms manufacturer in the world. It's under Samuel Cummings, a former CIA man. He's got warehouses over there in Alexandria, the wharf on the waterfront full of these arms. The CIA and the private arms dealings who deal with CIA have a lot of these facilities and you have to make a connection.

**Michael Fleet** I am not privy to special information. I know of no operative channels through which something like that would pass. It certainly does, and it's true because the materials shows up at the other end. But exactly how it's done, I don't know and I suppose if I did know I'd be in trouble.

**Tim McGovern** (singing)

**Tim McGovern** Most of the policing equipment and techniques used in Latin America were tested and perfected by the United States in Vietnam. Senator Abourezk discussed one of the most horrifying of these techniques, torture. Although Quinn Tamm, head of the International Association of Chiefs of Police disagrees, Senator Abourezk contends to students at the International Police Academy at least become familiar with this.

**James Abourezk** It's obvious that there is some discussion about the uses of torture during the classes.

**Quinn Tamm** I don't know what upon the Senator's basis is, this allegation. That is not the purpose of the Academy, and that is not what I had seen the Academy teaching. If they're doing that, they may be doing it late at night.

**James Abourezk** We found some theses, graduate papers written by some of the students that talk about torture, using much of the same language throughout all the various theses. So it's obvious that torture had been discussed.

**Quinn Tamm** That's ridiculous to think that the school conducted by our State Department which would be involved in the teaching of the training of torture. No, I just don't believe this.

**Michael Klare** They don't have to train people in the use of torture, they're all sophisticated enough to know that those people are going to use torture in those countries. And that they're perfectly capable of learning the techniques themselves. The job of the Police Academy is to train people in methodologies and skills and this sort of thing. The instructors know that the police are going to use these skills and methodology as they see fit and they have a con-political orientation so they know who is going to be the targets and victims of those skills. But they don't say, "Here's how you go about torturing anyone." So we know that they have that bomb school in Texas, at Los Fresnos, Texas, where the CIA train policemen in the use of homemade bombs and assassination weapons and explosives and things like that. And I'm sure that when they train people they say, "Listen, here's the equipment and here's the skills and you guys know what to do with it." But they'll never be specific about that.

**Tim McGovern** Let's take a look at the Latin American countries with large numbers of political prisoners. The country whose abuses of prisoners has received perhaps the largest amount of public attention, and substantive amount of US aid, is Chile. When the Chilean consul was asked about these abuses, he blamed overseas interrogators operating in Chile and the people who had been arrested.

**Chilean Consul** High government officials freely acknowledge they have been abused against suspects by overseers' interrogators. They point to extenuating circumstances including sniping against police and soldiers. And an emotional kind of class hatred by the maxed militants. Perhaps more important, I found no evidence that the top military authorities ever ordered or approved the abuse of suspects.

**Tim McGovern** As for political prisoners.

**Chilean Consul** There are not political prisoners, in the first case there were many people detained, not taken prisoners. But in the [inaudible 00:28:18] we will clarify his positions. They were freed and the well-known masses' leaders, accused of common crimes, where left in the custody.

**Timothy Harding** It's ridiculous that many thousands of people are supposed to have been engaging in some kind of common criminal activities just doesn't make any sense.

**Tim McGovern** Professor Harding.

**Timothy Harding** It's obvious to any observer, and this has been made clear in interviews with US officials, you've probably heard that even the US Ambassador, who's totally in support of the regime down there, was raising the issue of political prisoners and the use of torture in talks with the Chilean government, and was slapped on the wrist by Kissinger for doing it. So it shows that the US Ambassador is perfectly aware that these people are not in jail for criminal activities. I think it's even more important to realize that these people were not arrested because they were engaging in political opposition. They didn't even give them a chance, they arrested them because they knew from their connection to the former government, that if given the chance they probably would oppose the government. And so because they supposed they would oppose the government, that's why they were arrested. They were arrested because they were on lists of police lists, intelligence lists gathered by the United States, by the Chilean government, by the Brazilian secret service in Chile. And these are the people that the government is calling common criminals.

**Tim McGovern** So according to Professor Harding, the Chilean government has used American and Brazilian practices and personnel. What Martin Hall of Coalition for the Restoration of Democracy in Chile, says that the Chilean Junta has also used some of the practices and personnel of the Third Reich.

**Martin Hall** There's a parallel between the methods that Hitler and the Nazis used in Germany in 1933 to establish their fascist dictatorship; in which are used, almost copied, step-by-step by the Junta in Chile.

**Timothy Harding** Perhaps 20 thousand people were killed after the coup and there's no telling how many political prisoners are being held. The government announced in September that they we're going to release those political prisoners who are being held simply for opposition of the government and only hold those guilty of the most heinous crimes and so on. As far as I know, they've only released about 50-75 people. And they were holding several thousand. So that was a phony move designed to sort of throw people off the track of the continued use of political imprisonment and torture.

**Martin Hall** There was also a report that one of the people who were lucky enough to escape one of concentration camps, the prisoners were soon tortured, constantly. Several of them have grown insane in the mean time. They are put are into small cubicles of not more than four feet square. Not only one but two or three and held they are without water, without food. And many of them have lost their mind.

**Charles Wiggins** I do not though, approve of any intra policies which deprive citizens of a country of their human rights.

**Tim McGovern** Congressman Wiggins.

**Charles Wiggins** That's not to say, that because of my opposition to that policy, I am prepared to advocate that government deal with their own and be replaced by one which is adverse to the interests of the United States. Proper solution to an internal problem is when the people of that region correct it internally.

**Martin Hall** Girls have been raped in the camps by the guards. Those who have become sick, especially those in the northern part of Chile. In the southern part of Chile, in the Antarctic were sent to a camp that is absolutely impossible to live there in an arctic conditions and without any aid, medical or otherwise. The Humans Rights Commission of the Organization of American States was visiting south, the concentration camps, but not the three most ominous ones where you know that torture is fact, took place everyday.

**Martin Hall** We're reporting that 222 opponents of the Junta and former loyalists supporters of Allende have been executed without trial.

**Charles Wiggins** We had a hostile communist movement in Chile, hostile to the interests of the United States and one, it was practicing the internationally acceptable, perhaps art of confiscating American properties, that we don't have to be enthusiastic about that.

**Martin Hall** And there was a close colleague, Adolf Eichmann, a man who was responsible personally for the killing of at least 97 thousand Jewish people, a man who was as an SS Colonel, invented before they had the gas ovens in the concentration camps; he invented the so-called gas tanks. Tanks into which criminals were herded and that were then hermetically sealed and the exhaust fumes from the running motors were injected into the tanks to usually fifteens minutes usually for about fifty people to die. Man who invented them, and the man who was in charge of them; man who organized the first scientific mass killing under Hitler has been appointed by General Pinochet by the head of the Junta to supervise the administration of prisons, especially the treatment of the political prisoners. This man now is a government official, and what we should not forget is that he's an official of a government that is recognized by the United States, a government for which you and my taxpayers' money is being spent in military and financial aid to the Junta.

**Charles Wiggins** I'm personally more satisfied that the present government is more friendly to the United States than was the Allende government.

**Martin Hall** We have not only overthrown Allende, we pour tons of millions of dollars ever since the coup into Chile, in order to make a success of this fascist government. What we are sure is protecting the interests of whatever American investors have their capital invested in Chile, or will invest it.

**Charles Wiggins** I don't know, in my own knowledge, what role the United States played, I understand that it was covert and that we lent some support to opposition candidates to then President Allende.

**Timothy Harding** The Chilean government not only stays in power because of continued US aid, but it got there because of US aid to forces that overthrew the Chilean government.

**Charles Wiggins** The Unites States I'm told, I have no reason to doubt this, did not mastermind the coup in that country that resulted in the overthrow of Allende.

**Timothy Harding** I mean the United States, as we know, poured money into the trucker's strike and into military aid and into counterinsurgency, coordinating during the Allende's regime, which made it possible for the government to come into power, then now continues to aid that regime to stabilize and control.

**Tim McGovern** In order to get information on the mistreatment of political prisoners in other Latin American countries, we went to Amnesty International. Amnesty is a London-based pacifist organization which tries to obtain due process of law for people who are imprisoned solely for their political beliefs.

**Tim McGovern** Dave Boxall reads excerpt from their reports on countries with substantial numbers of political prisoners. Countries which all receive US military and police aid.

**Dave Boxall** Argentina, Amnesty International has documented 73 methods of torture, some of them are: electric prod, used for shocking various parts of the body; the telephone, which consists of beating prisoners from behind on both ears causing temporarily or sometimes permanent deafness; and the parrot perch, that's a combination of hanging, near drowning in filthy water and multiple electric shocks simultaneously. Some of the most refined torture equipment in the world is used by a group of Argentine cadets, led and organized by some of the country's top military officers.

**Dave Boxall** Amnesty International's report on Haiti says, "It's rather obvious that there are several basic human rights problems. A total lack of proceedings after arrest and no subsequent contact with either family, lawyer or priest. And families are not even informed when the prisoner has died in detention. Amnesty has received a report of one prisoner, a lawyer, who was released and seen in public. Two weeks later, he was rearrested and has not been heard of since."

**Timothy Harding** Lawyers have been themselves arrested and tortured for failing to give the government information like interviews that they had with their clients, privileged information that a lawyer in no country is required to give. And if lawyers continue to defend political prisoners they're put in jail on trumped up charges and themselves tortured and held without charge. So it discourages anyone from giving an adequate legal defense to these people.

**Dave Boxall** There are a number of political prisoners in Columbia who have been charged with rebellion and association commit a criminal offense. Others have been detained from allegedly having links to the extreme left-wing National Liberation Army. The end of December 1973 when state of siege was finally lifted, the Columbian Supreme Court declared that these prisoners should no longer be tried by the military tribunals, they were reportedly released soon afterwards. However, they too had been subjected to tortures. Also, the lawyers for these prisoners have been excluded from trial proceedings and some had been threatened.

**Dave Boxall** Amnesty International has received regular reports from Guatemala, persons who disappear without a trace. The authorities claim that these people have left the country on their own accord and investigations into their whereabouts continue. However, due to the unsatisfactory results of these investigations, Amnesty International recommended that the governments set up an impartial commission of inquiry. Their recommendation has never been heeded. The are hundreds of these missing persons cases and in each one, there've been charges that the police and military have taken part in the abductions.

**Dave Boxall** The nature of the victims, varying from people showing left-wing sympathies to petty criminals and the fact that the bodies found show evident signs of torture point to the existence of death squads. As a matter of fact, sometimes the death squad card is left on these bodies. One of the death squad victims was the Christian Democrat candidate, the Mayor of a provincial town. He was one of the 50 bodies recently found in a disused well. In October of 1973, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked to send its own impartial team of inquiry to investigate, the Guatemalan government refused.

**Timothy Harding** This considerable amount of information on torturing and imprisonment in Guatemala has been going on in the most incredible way, ever since the United States helped overthrow the government in 1954.

**Dave Boxall** The author of an Amnesty International report on prison conditions in Paraguay spent three weeks there interviewing leaders of the three main opposition parties. He also talked with lawyers, journalists, priests and social workers. According to the investigator, there is no doubt that torture is and has been the usual means of gaining confessions and money from the prisoners. In his report, Amnesty's representative said the torture in Paraguay often ends in death and is carried out in the presence of top police officials. The techniques usually witnessed by the Army Generals include physical brutality and sexual abuse of women prisoners. The victims are often only relatives to suspected communists. The actual suspects are usually disposed of by the government.

**Dave Boxall** There is also a growing repression of students and foreigners in Paraguay. They are arrested arbitrarily and subjected to brutal treatment. Several students were arrested and refused due process of law. They weren't arrested for major offenses, simply for being connected with slogan painted on street walls. The slogans protesting the government's economic policies.

**Timothy Harding** Many of these governments would not have taken power without West support and assurance before they took power that after they were in power that they would get total US support. For instance, the military probably would not have been able to agree and coordinate on having the coup to oust the Goulart government of Brazil in 1964 had it not been for the previous support and assurance given by the military attaches to the United States, the US Ambassador and so on. That once they overthrew the government, that the aid with which had been withheld from Brazil would be immediately made available in large quantities and the United States would see them through the economic difficulties of stabilizing the repressive regime after they took over.

**Dave Boxall** Amnesty International has received countless reports of Brazil political prisoners being tortured. Official permission to carry out investigations has been denied. In 1972, Amnesty prepared a statement on Brazil and torture allegation. It was based on reports from eye witnesses, lawyers, journalists and others. Their document showed clear evidence of physical, mental and sexual abuse. Prisoners are often forced to watch their family and friend being tortured.

**Dave Boxall** The Brazilian government responded to the report by imposing a new press law, forbidding the publication of Amnesty International statements in Brazil. Amnesty concluded that torture is widespread administrative practice used in most police and military interrogations. The Brazilian forces have their own interrogation centers which are directed by the Department for Public Safety. In hearings before a United States congressional subcommittee on aid to Brazil, allegations were raised concerning possible US involvement with the Brazilian tortures.

**Timothy Harding** In the case of Bolivia, the United States and Brazil together organized the overthrow of the Bolivian government in 1971 and continued to support that government in power.

**Dave Boxall** In regards to the abuse of opponents to Bolivia's military government, Amnesty International has received a document entitled, "Evangelism and Violence." It was published by 99 members of the Bolivian Church and denounced what it termed the physical and morally degrading tortures, including the rape of some women prisoners. According to other documents, most tortures are carried out shortly after arrest in the criminal investigation department and in the Ministry of the Interior. As a matter of fact, high-ranking officers of the interior ministry have personally inducted and advised in the tortures.

**Dave Boxall** Amnesty International's report on the Dominican Republic says, "The most elementary human rights consistently have been violated and all political opposition has been suppressed." Allegations included numerous political assassinations carried out by death squads, with the open support of the national police.

**Dave Boxall** Amnesty has received photographs of prisoners with severe lesions from torture sessions. Techniques like constant beating and nocturnal interrogation have been used by the secret service. Sheer brutality is common in the national prison. High-ranking officers in the national police force have frequently been accused of complicity in and responsibility for the torture.

**Dave Boxall** Uruguay's urban guerrilla movement, the Tupamaros, have led the government to modes of repression in their attempt to control the rules. Torture is a routine procedure after the arrest of a Tupamaros suspect or sympathizer. The prisoners are blindfolded to prevent identification of the torturer. Common techniques used are standing with legs apart for many hours or days. Or tying the prisoner to a plank and submerging him in water. Reports received by Amnesty International allege that Advisors from the United States and Brazil are training Uruguayan police in counterinsurgency methods which include the use of torture.

**Dave Boxall** The purpose of the torture is to extract confessions from suspected guerrillas. However, many citizens not affiliated with the Tupamaros invariably becomes victims of arrest and torture.

**Timothy Harding** Since Uruguay has abandoned constitutional government, even before when they were a constitutional government before they instituted their dictatorship there. There were large numbers of political prisoners and political terror was used against the left, not simply the Tupamaros but the Communist Party, another group on the left that not even advocates taking armed action. It advocated participating in elections and so on. They were frequently arrested and the government shot up their headquarters and so on. They were hauled in on suspected charges of this and that, and tortured.

**Dave Boxall** Amnesty International believes that many political prisoners in Ecuador have given confessions while in pain from torture. They received testimony from one prisoners denouncing extreme physical tortures that drove him to the verge of suicide. Another man, a journalist and writer was found guilty of planning a bank robbery. The legal grounds for his conviction was a confession. A confession extracted under torture. It seems that the real reason for his arrest was his support of Ecuador's Socialist Party and his writings. He's often criticized corruption of Ecuadorian politicians.

**Timothy Harding** The taking of political prisoners is not simply an aspect of repression of guerrilla movements, it's part of the general political control of the society. A very large number of these political prisoners never engaged in armed action against their country. It's very common to simply arrest people and hold them for long periods of time, torture them, and simply not release them for years at at time.

**Dave Boxall** In Venezuela, according to Amnesty International, political opponents have disappeared under strange circumstances, some while on detention. Tortures are allegedly carried by high-ranking intelligence service officers. According to testimony received by Amnesty International, tortures include electric shock through the use of a field telephone, prolonged exposure in tiger hole, beatings, burnings, and simulated executions. The torturers are military personnel. The accounts of torture you just heard were all taken from reports published by Amnesty International.

**Timothy Harding** The fact is that Amnesty International's information about political prisoners is more than conservative accurate. I mean they don't print information when they don't have confirmed cases. And they admit, and I am convinced that the situation is much worse than how they portray it because there are thousands of cases about which they can't get enough information one way or another to be able to list it as a confirmed case, you know like a mysterious disappearance. And then there are rumors of the persons being held in a certain place, but who can get there to find out?

**Tim McGovern** One way of obtaining this information is through correspondence with people who live in these countries and are privy to reports of this type. Senator Abourezk has received some of these accounts.

**James Abourezk** This is a letter I got in November of 1973 from a woman who lives in Thailand. She is talking about women in Vietnam that she has interviewed personally and she has talking now about a widow, 32-years old, Mrs [Ne-goy-en Tee Non 00:50:06] from Saigon and she was arrested in an anti-feud demonstration where she was demanding, quote, "Peace, freedom, stop the draft for the right to live, and she was first brought to [Kwa-ahng 00:50:21] number three police station in Saigon ...

**Speaker 12** "... police station in Saigon. She was for a week and police damaged her vagina with an iron stick and gave her an electric shock. They also forced soapy water into her mouth and then pounded on her stomach. She was then transferred to [Kwa-ahng 00:50:37] number six ...

**James Abourezk** "... [Kwa-ahng 00:50:39] number six police station and she recalls the chief torturer in that station as a man named [Nam Lung 00:50:45] and she asked that the Senate should demand to see a list of all South Vietnamese police trained in the United States. She says she believes there will be at least 64 in the International Police Academy this year, that means 1973. But here at the second place she's tied to a ceiling, beaten by four policemen.

**Speaker 12** "... by four policeman, electric shocked again and had another iron stick inserted into her vagina. She bled a great deal and lost consciousness. After a week of no food or water, sitting in a cell with a tight rubber bandage over her head, Mrs. Non was transferred to police headquarters. The police there told her that the three US men in uniform present at her torture were CIA agents. Mrs. Non told me that two Americans watched and one participated with the Vietnamese police. This one American ordered the Vietnamese police to put nails under her fingernails. She said that he also beat her on the ears, and then told the Vietnamese the police to force her stand with a light bulb shined close to her eyes for several days.

**Speaker 12** "After ten days, she was tortured again. When ten Vietnamese police beat her up and sexually abused her. Mrs. Non told me she saw several pregnant women at police headquarters whom miscarried because of their tortures."

**James Abourezk** And then I've got another letter from two of my constituents out in South Dakota. Let me read excerpts from this letter.

**James Abourezk** "My wife and I've spent the summer in Eastern Bolivia. Stories of..."

**Speaker 13** "Stories of torture and execution under the Banzer dictatorship circulate freely. We spent a few days in Uruguay were we lived as Mennonite missionary teachers for many years with our son and daughter-in-law. We visited two friends. One a Methodist Minister and seminary teacher, the other also a Methodist Minister, who were just recently freed from prison.

**Speaker 13** "They have stories of torture, near drowning, electrical shock while underwater with an instrument inserted in the rectum. The occasions of having been placed in front of a firing squad, blindfolded to try to get them to implicate others and so forth, were almost unbelievable. Especially in what was only a few short years ago, the land of absolute freedom of expression, the Switzerland of South America.

**Speaker 13** "At least one of the torturers told one of our friends that he had learned his technique in a special American school in the Canal Zone. An American missionary friend who was tortured for four days before his release insists that at least one American was involved in the torture squad. Although, I dare not mention names, it would be easy for me to document what has happened and what is happening. Must we support this sort of regime in Latin America and Africa? How far are we from the same kind of police state?"

**James Abourezk** This is dated June 27th, 1974. The informant we have was a young leader in large and proud union of forestry workers. This is what came to us from somebody in Chile.

**James Abourezk** "The union leaders put radio equipment plus at least ...

**Speaker 14** "... at least six hundred deserters. Organized five months of armed guerrilla activity both east and west of Osorno. He told a tragic tale of the violence and repression which I'm sure the outside world well knows by now.

**Speaker 14** "But I am compelled to add is a tale of the United States Advisor's card. Between the 28th and 30th of November, about two hundred of the troops were pursuing a small band of eight resistors, one of the eight was captured and could be heard crying out under torture. His companions returned to save him.

**Speaker 14** "They observed 12 Junta soldiers practicing a system of torture and death. The victim was nearly nude, tied to a teeter-tooter plank, above a drum of water. His head would be dosed while hot coals would be applied to his legs. And half-drowned he would be revived and questioned. A man without insignia, talking good Spanish without an accent, was giving orders to another, with Lieutenant's insignia.

**Speaker 14** "The guerrillas attacked, rescued their dying friend and killed the Junta soldiers. A closer inspection of the man without insignia revealed a man 36 to 39 years of age, flat-top, butch haircut. Light-complexion, left arm tattoo and right arm tattoo. In his shirt pocket, there was an identification card issued to Advisors. On one side was an Anglo-Saxon name. The card read: [foreign language 00:55:28].

**Speaker 14** "One of the Junta soldiers admitted before he died that all in the squad had shared in the torture. The place was east of Osorno. The victim died of infection and blood loss. His chest was sliced by a sharp blade. His testicles were crushed. A large branch had been shoved deep into his rectum."

**Tim McGovern** After an investigation of this last letter, Pacifica's Paz Cohen discovered additional information.

**Paz Cohen** Photocopies of the card and the story reached Washington. Of checks by Congressional offices came up with Defense Department denials of the man's existence. There has been no definitive denial from the CIA.

**Paz Cohen** The dead soldiers' bodies were searched and the US military ID card was found on the one who had seemed to be directing the interrogation. The card identified has Charles [Star-ley 00:56:22], Advisor, Service Of Military Intelligence, and bore a serial number and a series of letters. The card also said both Army of Chile and US Army, [inaudible 00:56:33] and military attache offices. At least two congressional offices have asked the Defense Department about Charles Starley, and both have been told, "No one by that name is in the Army records."

**Paz Cohen** Members of the Fifth Estate of the spy office in Washington say chances are great that the name was either false or that the Pentagon removed Starley's records. There is also the possibility they say, that Starley was a CIA operative.

**Tim McGovern** In response to evidence of US complicity with torture on an international scale, Senator Abourezk has presented a Bill to Congress that would cut off funds to institutions like International Police Academy, and prohibit the training of foreign police in the United States. However, even if this amendment is adopted, it's effectiveness is questionable.

**Michael Klare** There are lots of ways in which the government can get around such an amendment.

**Tim McGovern** Michael Klare.

**Michael Klare** By channeling money through the military appropriation which was not covered by the Amendment.

**Quinn Tamm** It just means someone else will have to do something.

**Tim McGovern** Of the IAPC.

**Quinn Tamm** To assist the police departments in the training programs where they have not advanced as far as we have in this country.

**Michael Klare** Training could be provided by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the IACP, which has it's headquarters in Washington, DC. Also, police equipment corporations like Smith & Wesson and companies like that could sell weapons and provide training they use. And another thing to look for, is the incredible expansion of the private police company, like [inaudible 00:58:23] Incorporated and Pinkerton and Burn's Guards. All of these companies are opening offices all over the Third World to provide protection for US corporations that have plants in those countries. Now I am certain that these companies will expand their work to include training guards and so forth in those countries.

**Tim McGovern** And so, just as the war in Indochina continues, the war in Latin America will continue, the war without end.

**Tim McGovern** This program is produced at KPFK, Pacifica Radio Los Angeles, by David Morrison and myself, Tim McGovern.

**Tim McGovern** Technical assistance by [inaudible 00:59:14] Bob Lowe and TG.

**James Abourezk** US Taxpayers' money ought to be used for humanitarian purposes, but not for military aid nor should it be used to support and prop up military dictatorships that undertake this kind of repressive action, that is, imprisoning their own people and torturing them, simply for political dissent, political disagreement.
