**Dick Cavett** Kurt Vonnegut Jr. is a brand name that turns up on the very best of bestseller lists, just about seems like every other year. And his work is even wise enough to be appreciated by the younger generation, the ones that we're told don't read. So obviously, there must be some of them that do. He's a social commentator, I guess, as well as a storyteller. The story that he is going to bring us today is hair raising and profoundly important, I think. And so greetings, Mr. Vonnegut, once again, after all these years. You've just come back from Mozambique, a name that only meant something to me because of my stamp collection as a tiny boy, for many years.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Well, that was my frame of mind too. And I was invited to go there by CARE, who is a principal relief organization operating there. And so I said, "Sure, let's go." And so now I've swum in all three oceans, I had never swum in the Indian Ocean and I made a point of that.

**Dick Cavett** You thought without hesitation, "Let's go"?

**Kurt Vonnegut** Oh yeah. Yeah, well I said in one book, unusual travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God. But I have indeed, by golly, been to Mozambique. And I am in a position where I can actually know what I'm talking about, which is unusual in my case.

**Dick Cavett** Do you think in this world where we're told that the average American can't find Canada or Mexico on a map; I think there's a lot of the students can't find Mozambique.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Oh, I think it's quite true, yeah. Well, it is on the East Coast of Africa, on the Indian Ocean, it's about twice the size of California. And it's a famous place where people are starving, there's a hell of a lot of them. And over a million refugees, there's people unable to farm or look after themselves at all. And so there are many relief agencies operating there. But this has nothing to do with the weather, it's very much like California, it's that beautiful, it has the longest coastline in Africa. It's not overpopulated, they haven't over bred, they're only 14 million people and two Californias. And it should be paradise except it is an absolute nightmare. And the reason is political. It has nothing to do with the lack of rainfall or overpopulation or anything. It's utterly manmade.

**Dick Cavett** How'd it get that way? Can you give us a little primer on that? It used to be Portuguese, isn't it?

**Kurt Vonnegut** Yeah. Well, it sure did. And this country is so young. I mean we think, or at least I do, the Vietnam war having been only yesterday, is Mozambique became a nation in the same year that we got kicked out of Vietnam. That's 1975. And the Portuguese were about the last of the Imperialists to let go of their colonies. And the Mozambicans finally did kick them out. But Portugal itself is a very poor country. And the minute the Portuguese were kicked out, the Mozambicans, who had got nothing from the Portuguese, they hadn't even been allowed to drive taxi cabs to learn to drive. They had been kept a very primitive state. They hadn't been taught to read or write, they had gotten no medical help.

And so they looked for help, "Here, we've got this swell country and pretty good people, but we're ignorant and where can we get some help?" And the help came from the Soviet union. It didn't come from us. And so they became that most awful of things as a Marxist state. Now that was in 1975 in South Africa. And Rhodesians, whites, immediately formed this guerrilla group, which is still operating, which is called Renamo, which is against the government. And this is the National Resistance of Mozambique. That's what Renamo is.

**Dick Cavett** Well, who are we for?

**Kurt Vonnegut** Well, we are finally for the government as the Cold War is finally over. And the Mozambicans, I must say, the few sufficiently well educated to have heard of Moscow or of Karl Marx, are as sick of socialism as anybody in East Berlin and Moscow, or Budapest. Everybody who's tried it has finally given up on it. And so they're trying to get a mixed economy going.

**Dick Cavett** For a time to try to help the suffering people there was to label yourself a "pinko". [crosstalk 00:05:09].

**Kurt Vonnegut** Well, that's right. And well, some people still call Renamo freedom fighters. There's some people in this country do. And when you go over and see what they've done, I mean, these are illiterate bandits in the countryside. They were financed for a while by South Africa, perfectly openly. And I believe by the CIA.

**Dick Cavett** Really?

**Kurt Vonnegut** But they behaved so atrociously that our own state department recently published a paper on atrocities committed by Renamo.

**Dick Cavett** Is there anything new in atrocities that haven't been heard of before?

**Kurt Vonnegut** Yes, yes. What is new? Well, I've seen a great deal of starvation, and as a prisoner of war, when the war ended, I didn't get back to our lines for about 10 days. And I wound up with the concentration camp people and a whole lot of others, and I was pretty skinny myself. So I'd seen hunger then. And then I wound up in Nigeria during the Biafran Civil War on the Biafran side. And of course they were completely blockaded. There's no food was coming in. So I'd seen starvation there. I'd seen kwashiorkor and terrible hunger.

And so that's what I saw again, as I say, over a million people hungry in this paradise. Well, what is new, what I hadn't seen before, is people mutilated. [crosstalk 00:06:39]. And they had people who had fallen into the hands of Renamo and another word for them is Banditos, is bandits. And that's in fact what they are. And yeah, they cut people's fingers off and ears off and noses off, it's a pretty standard thing to cut noses off.

**Dick Cavett** So even you who had seen Dresden and other things were...

**Kurt Vonnegut** Yeah. But I needn't actually have gone to Mozambique to find that out, that too is in the state department report.

**Dick Cavett** Let's take a look; do we have time in this segment, I'll ask openly? And see if, we have some tape here, and if you can watch it.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Yeah.

**Dick Cavett** And tell us what we're seeing. Can you roll that?

**Kurt Vonnegut** Yeah. Well, this is one of many, many refugee centers in Mozambique, about the middle of Mozambique, inland in beautiful mountains. And about 180,000 people have been driven off their farms and into this refugee center, and they continue to be attacked there. The Mozambican army is so poor that they can't really defend these people here, but everything that these people eat has to be flown in.

**Dick Cavett** They have both famine and civil war.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Yeah. And CARE does most of this, they happen to be passing out food that came in from the International Red Cross, which is run by Swiss. But these are people waiting in line. And another part, people are arriving every day, without tools, often naked, having terrible stories to tell. Over here I'm afraid there's a dying person. But the people who arrive this sick wind up in a particular part of the camp, special tents, and who need immediate help. And about five a day die, of new arrivals. But again, this is all political. Renamo is not growing, they're hated, they don't govern anywhere they take over, they simply loot it. We'll have hit and run raids and burn schools and burn hospitals.

**Dick Cavett** Who profits from killing those people? What do they think that's going to accomplish?

**Kurt Vonnegut** Well, they figure that anything is bad for the government is good for Renamo, but they have no following whatsoever. And that's a mystery now about who is financing them. South Africa and Mozambique had a treaty finally that they weren't going to interfere with each other any more, as Mozambique's end of it was that they would stop giving aid and comfort to the ANC, the African national Congress, which is the enemy of apartheid, and as nearly as I can tell South Africa openly back.

**Dick Cavett** And you mentioned the CIA.

**Kurt Vonnegut** And the CIA, but we don't do that any more. And it's a fact we don't do it any more.

**Dick Cavett** You're not being ironic there, you really say it is a fact?

**Kurt Vonnegut** Yeah, but of course there are all these private governments now. And a guy from CARE who, as I say, CARE brought me over there, and Christopher Wren from the New York Times and a guy from Newsweek and a stringer for the Washington Post. But our guide was a man named Neff, Dave Neff.

**Dick Cavett** Having introduced him, let me take a break and we'll be right back with Kurt Vonnegut and more about Mozambique.

Talking with Kurt Vonnegut about Mozambique. Do you suppose if you asked the average person, "What are the major problems and troubles in the world today?" They would take a long time before they got down to mentioning Mozambique? I'm talking about in America.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Yeah, but you realize...

**Dick Cavett** We're so preoccupied, and what you've seen is so horrifying that I don't know if I could... Some of the stuff you told me during the break was so ghastly.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Well, I mean after all, we don't want to worry about the whole world. This thing is in the Southern hemisphere, please can't somebody else worry about that. And it's in the other hemisphere. But this is a particularly maddening catastrophe because it's completely manmade.

**Dick Cavett** Except for the drought or the famine part, you mean?

**Kurt Vonnegut** Well no, they don't have a drought.

**Dick Cavett** Oh, the famine is man-made as well, is it?

**Kurt Vonnegut** Oh yeah.

**Dick Cavett** They had no drought.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Entirely? It's not that they've had the crops they were...

**Dick Cavett** Oh no, these people would all be very happy farmers in an area where there's plenty of room for everybody, there's decent rainfall, the soil is reasonably good. And the only reason they're starving to death is they've all been driven off their farms by this gang called Renamo.

**Kurt Vonnegut** So it's all that. It's not one of the...

**Dick Cavett** It's totally. And the roads are impassable because Renamo has mined them and stages ambushes on them. As CARE has had trucks shot up, they have ordered trucks now with steel plates on the bottom, because they're liable to hit a mine at any time. Now this is about 45,000 people, the Renamo is, over a huge area as I say, about two Californias, and they can be anywhere. And they have no capital you could attack, when they're lying in ambush they're off the road so no plane could spot them waiting there. And a mine they sow could be there for years before it was touched off.

**Kurt Vonnegut** And one of the things you're saying is the Live Aid concert sort of fundraising and food and so on is hijacked along the way by a good percent of the bandits.

**Dick Cavett** Yeah, it is. But what's interesting about Live Aid, because of flower children, and you've had them on your show.

**Kurt Vonnegut** You go back to a [crosstalk 00:13:06].

**Dick Cavett** Think that they can bring food and give it to the people. And it doesn't work that way at all. And CARE has been in this business for a long time, and this profession of relief specialist has come into being with people who work for CARE that I met there, most of them have worked in five, six, seven, eight other countries. It's all over the world. The Gaza Strip, the Philippines, wherever there're hungry people. And they are not bleeding hearts. They're experts at warehousing, at shipping, all different kinds of shipping. Had accounting to make sure the stuff gets there whenever possible.

And Renamo does hit the trucks and does hit their planes and does hit their boats as they try to get food here and there. But most of Renamo's thefts take place after the food has been delivered, because they attack these refugee centers and they're practically undefended. And the refugees themselves they've given a little land when they arrive and a little garden plot, but they don't build much of a house because Renamo keeps coming in and burning their houses down. When Renamo shows up they head for the bush, that's what everybody does. And everything is stolen.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Well, it sounds hopeless.

**Dick Cavett** Well, it does. But the mystery now is who is financing Renamo. And I started to talk about Dave Neff, who's a guy from New Athens, Illinois. He's a really beautiful American, he's about 43 years old, started in the Peace Corps, but he's worked for CARE for years. And he told me that this is very cheap to support a force like this, because all they need is ammunition. They steal their food, they live off the land. And so one rich man could support them.

**Kurt Vonnegut** They're his bandits [crosstalk 00:15:09].

**Dick Cavett** Well the cost is about $4 million a year, he estimates. And this brings all transportation in this country that's trying to be born to a halt as the power lines are cut again and again. And there may be a few private individuals smuggling in the weapons.

**Kurt Vonnegut** What do they get out of it?

**Dick Cavett** What do the people who back it? Well, they may be staunchly anti communist. And as I say, this started out as a Marxist government because the first help came from Russia. But also Marxism is very appealing, it's from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs, it sounds very close to the Sermon on the Mount, except it hasn't worked very well in practice. But this is such attractive real estate, I would suppose that the backers of Renamo, should the Mozambican government fall, because Renamo is not capable of governing. It's never done it. The sponsors, presumably white, would get special concessions.

**Kurt Vonnegut** And a lot of good real estate.

**Dick Cavett** And a hell of a lot of good real estate.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Let's talk more about who they might be when we get back, we have to take a break and we'll come back.

**Dick Cavett** All right.

**Kurt Vonnegut** We were talking about the fact that one, two or three individuals could have in fact his own set of electric trains, only in this case, it's people being wiped out.

**Dick Cavett** Yeah. It's freedom fighters, have his own His own freedom fighters.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Sees himself as further taunting the ghost of Karl Marx, I guess.

**Dick Cavett** Yes. And well, fighting evil.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Evil, yeah.

**Dick Cavett** Some people in this country have called these guys freedom fighters, but they are illiterate and exist simply for themselves now, as they are bandits, out in the wilderness, and are much hated.

**Kurt Vonnegut** If you met them, did you meet them?

**Dick Cavett** Well, the state department document about the atrocities they committed was in fact taken from interviews with prisoners of war. And I hoped they would capture Renamo. But if you caught one, if you met one on the street, you wouldn't know whether he was Renamo or not as they have no uniform.

**Kurt Vonnegut** And do they feel zeal, if they're doing something other than getting a kick out of maybe being entrusted with a weapon and killing people?

**Dick Cavett** Well, as war itself can be entertaining in itself, and being an outlaw on a post must be a hell of a kick, because they hit and run where there's nobody to stop them. And this is robbing and you can see where this would... And what Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. said about the civil war, it was good it ended when it did, because he was growing too fond of...

**Kurt Vonnegut** A little mordant, isn't it.

**Dick Cavett** Yeah.

**Kurt Vonnegut** And did you think you had seen the worst you could see at Dresden? Dresden is always held up as one of the worst things that's ever happened in humankind, whenever we pointed the finger at anybody bad, they say, "Don't forget about Dresden, what you did."

**Dick Cavett** No. That was an adventure in my life. And I was simply amazed by it. But what is effectively, far more was a visit to Auschwitz I only made a couple of years ago and saw a whole building full of children's shoes and toys.

**Kurt Vonnegut** They're still there.

**Dick Cavett** Oh yeah. They're all gathered in one building, the children's stuff. Well, then I saw terrible starvation because I ran into concentration camp people. No, the fire bombing of Dresden doesn't explain anything about me, but Mozambique will explain a lot about me from now on because watching the Cold War, Peter [inaudible 00:19:17] where these...

**Kurt Vonnegut** Got to interrupt you, damn it. Right on the word. We'll be right back. I'll bring you right back to it.

Talking with Kurt Vonnegut Jr. I had to cut you right at the point where you were saying, this will say something about me, Mozambique, whereas the fire bombing of Dresden doesn't. That remark in isolation is very intriguing. Can you enlighten us a little on that?

**Dick Cavett** Well, the Cold War has played such a large part in our lives since the Second World War and has been so upsetting, and now it is winding down.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Light at the end.

**Dick Cavett** We see what is going on in Mozambique is these innocent people, cast as Marxists, who never heard of Marx, who may have never heard of New York City, being tormented by illiterate bandits who consider themselves freedom fighters. And that sort of bologna is slowing down. And my Lord, it would be such a relief if it gets stopped, where only the weather would torment people from now and that only earthquakes and droughts.

**Kurt Vonnegut** What is it realistic to think will happen, you can make happen?

**Dick Cavett** Well, I'm a terrible pessimist and I think this can on indefinitely because neither side is nearly strong enough to win. And it would be so great if the United Nations had the power to step into a situation like this and say, "All right, everybody just stop."

**Kurt Vonnegut** What's been the attitude of, say, the Reagan administration toward this, and now the Bush administration?

**Dick Cavett** Well, we would have to guess what it is. I think that they went along with it, we've been for freedom fighters everywhere and likened them to Thomas Jefferson and so forth. And I think I'm not sure that will stop, as it seems to me the Bush administration is as obedient to the opinions of the lunatic fringe right in this country, so interested in pleasing them, that we may in fact be supporting these guys still who have brought all life to Mozambique to a halt.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Am I being too mystery reader about this, or do you have a hunch who individuals are who in fact are supporting this?

**Dick Cavett** Well, the answer wouldn't be very interesting to an American audience because I think probably the individuals are maybe Portuguese businessmen.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Oh, I see.

**Dick Cavett** Who lost their property. And also there are a lot of people who hate black people who don't wish well to any black nation.

**Kurt Vonnegut** See it as a genuine evil and in some [crosstalk 00:22:25].

**Dick Cavett** Well, that they simply don't deserve it. And this is, believe me, very choice property. But again...

**Kurt Vonnegut** Maybe that's all you need to know.

**Dick Cavett** Again, what I carried away from it is hopeful, is that we have this large standing army of relief specialists now who can, better than anybody else, keep things from spoiling and get them where the donors want them to go.

**Kurt Vonnegut** And as you say, CARE knows what its doing in this practical matter.

**Dick Cavett** Yeah. But they became...

**Kurt Vonnegut** We only have 10 seconds left.

**Dick Cavett** Oh, okay.

**Kurt Vonnegut** You want to use the 10 for anything in particular?

**Dick Cavett** Yeah. Well, one country that's very much on their mind right now is Poland. So here we are back again.

**Kurt Vonnegut** Thank you, Kurt Vonnegut Jr. for being with us. We'll be seeing you next time.
