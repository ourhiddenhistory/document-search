**Len Osanic** Hello, everyone. Welcome to another episode of Black Op Radio. This is your host, Len Osanic. Today we are speaking to author and researcher Bill Davy. Hello, Bill.

**Bill Davy** Good evening, Len. How are you?

**Len Osanic** Good. Thank you so much for taking time to discuss the case with Black Op Radio. You just had a lecture, which we have video of and we're going to be playing that as part two of today's episode but, for part one, we're just on the radio. I wanted to just lightly overview what you spoke about and maybe get into a few little details of three or four items that really piqued my interest.

**Bill Davy** Okay.

**Len Osanic** First of all, do you want to just give a one minute overview of what you spoke about just last week?

**Bill Davy** Sure. As you know, the meeting or the symposium was held on the campus of VMI [Virginia Military Institute] at the George Marshall Center for Leadership and Ethics and it was actually on September 2nd. It was myself, Jim DiEugenio and John Newman. And I had a multi part presentation where I initially started off talking about some of the conclusions in the House Select Committee final report, the ones that they got right. From there, led into some files that I dug out of the Church Committee files, which included files from the INS, the old Immigration and Naturalization Service, and talked about a gentleman named Wendell Roach that we can go into later. From there, talked a little bit about the Inspector General report that the CIA issued on the Castro assassination plots and then from there spoke a little bit about some ZR/RIFLE, project ZR/RIFLE files that I found some information about Hale Boggs and the CBS [Television] special that slammed Garrison and the Warren report critics. And then finished up with a little bit of information on Earl Warren himself. And that was pretty much it.

**Len Osanic** The overview that I got from it is, you went on to analyze information that has been dug out that most of it, if not all of it, vindicated Jim Garrison's work. So many times you brought up stuff that is now known and we have the paperwork for, this is what Jim Garrison was talking about. That's how I would summarize it if someone was, piqued their interest. I mean, I hope everyone will watch it.

First of all, your presentation was very good. I'm a long time JFK researcher and I know quite a bit and I'm almost learning something new and just the way your presentation flowed for I think it's approximately an hour, it was just really well done and I wanted to commend you on that. You did a really good job.

**Bill Davy** Oh thanks, I appreciate it. It was hard to tell to see the slides on that laptop that I was using up there. But yeah, no, I appreciate that.

**Len Osanic** We hear a lot of awful programs, you know, the _Tracking Oswald_\s or you know the bullshit and that so I mean it's only good that we get to talk to some of the researchers doing good work and really tell them how good it is. Just in comparison to such crap that's out there.

Now you mentioned a couple of things, I have a couple of items I want to bring up. When you mentioned the House Select Committee Assassinations, you just mentioned some of the things they got right. What do you want to tell people about their conclusion or things that they did get right in your opinion?

**Bill Davy** The highlights to me ... One of their conclusions would be that the committee, meaning the House Select Committee on Assassinations, found that the CIA mafia Cuban plots had all the elements necessary for a successful assassination conspiracy, and I'm quoting here: "People, motive and means and the evidence indicated that the participants, meaning the CIA and anti-Castro Cubans might well have considered using the resources at their disposal to increase their power and alleviate their problems by assassinating the president." I thought that was a pretty strong and noteworthy conclusion.

And the other conclusions that I thought were also noteworthy, one is relative to New Orleans and Jim Garrison's investigation. For instance, and again, quoting from the report, "During the course of its investigation, the committee developed several areas of credible evidence and testimony, indicating a possible association in New Orleans and elsewhere between Lee Harvey Oswald and David W. Ferrie. Further, the committee found that the Clinton witnesses," and I think most people know about the Clinton, Louisiana incident, we've talked about that before. "The committee found that the Clinton witnesses were credible and significant. It was the judgment of the committee that they were telling the truth as they knew it. If the witnesses were not only truthful, but accurate as well in their accounts, they established an association of an undetermined nature between Ferrie, Shaw and Oswald, less than three months before the assassination. The committee was therefore inclined to believe that Oswald was in Clinton, Louisiana in late August, early September '63 and that he was in the company of David Ferrie if not Clay Shaw."

That, as I asked my audience there at the symposium, does that remind you of anybody? And I flashed a picture of Jim Garrison at that point. House select committee's conclusions vindicated what Jim Garrison was saying back in 1966 through '69.

**Len Osanic** Now, another one of their conclusions when they're talking about the number of gunmen, they used the word "probably."

**Bill Davy** Yeah. Yeah, they use that a lot and they use a lot of weasel words like that.

**Len Osanic** Yeah, you know that's a curious word when I think of it, it probably is the result of two gunmen. You know, probably. Is that most likely? Probably. You know?

**Bill Davy** Right. It's a way of, it's an out for them in case, whoa, maybe we got it wrong or you know we don't want to offend or come to too strong of a conclusion here, so they throw in those weasel words like "probably." But, you know, if you look in the actual files of the House Select Committee, which I did in preparation of my book and Jim DiEugenio did as well for _Destiny Betrayed_, there's a lot more definitive evidence and conclusions that can be reached based on the raw data, the raw files and the way they present it in the report. The report itself is still pretty strong compared to the Warren Commission, obviously.

**Len Osanic** Right but not you read the newspapers. I think one of them said, "Well, so two people were shooting at the same time, so what? Lee Oswald's the one that hit him." It's like oh my god.

**Bill Davy** Yeah I loved that one. That was put out by _The New York Times_ and also by _The Washington Post_. They said, "Perhaps there were two lone nuts in Dealey Plaza that day." That one kind of cracked me up. Two lone nuts.

**Len Osanic** There's a couple other commissions and you talk about early on just Pike, Church and Rockefeller. Is there an item of research that piqued your interest that came out of the Church or Pike? Because not a lot of people know too much about that and you might induce people to look into that more if you just elaborate a little bit on some of the things you found.

**Bill Davy** Yeah. As people will see from watching the video later that the title of my presentation was "The New Files and The Season of Inquiry." And the Season of Inquiry being the 1970s. I explain in the presentation that it really was a season of inquiry. Start with Watergate and those hearings and we go through these various committees after that. The Pike Committee, the Rockefeller Commission, the Church Committee, the House Select Committee on Assassinations and they're all happening during the 1970s. So the Church Committee, which was investigating, its overall mandate was investigating intelligence activities, domestic intelligence activities but they had a subcommittee headed by Senator Schweiker of Pennsylvania and Gary Hart of Colorado and it was a Kennedy assassination subcommittee. And their mandate was really to look into how the various intelligence agencies reacted or responded to the Kennedy assassination but they went much further than that in their field investigation and so I started digging into the documentary evidence there and one of the reports that I found was a 155 page, another mistitled report called "Oswald in New Orleans." In fact, there's very little in it on Oswald in New Orleans but the stuff that is there, I thought was dynamite.

What the investigators for the church committee had done, they had gone to the INS office in New Orleans and the INS, for people who don't remember was the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the United States and after 9/11 it got rolled into the Department of Homeland Security and they changed their name to ICE and maybe Customs and Border Patrol is part of that as well. But prior to 9/11 it was the INS. And of course, their role was to monitor illegal aliens in the New Orleans area and at that time, 1963, anti-Castro Cubans were flooding into New Orleans. So they found the head of the New Orleans office of the INS, a gentleman named Wendell Roach. And they interviewed Roach over the phone. But what he revealed was really dynamite stuff.

He told them that they had begun surveillance of this group of anti-Castro Cubans headed by David Ferrie. And Roach knew all the details on Ferrie, about his Eastern Airlines dismissal, the salacious details of his private life, et cetera. They had surveilled Ferrie pretty good. And he stated that Ferrie had an office up on Camp Street. Obviously, referring to Guy Banister's office. We know Ferrie was in there, that's no secret. So he's obviously talking about 544 Camp. But he goes on and he tells the Church investigators that not only did they see David Ferrie going into 544 Camp but they had picked up Lee Harvey Oswald in the company of David Ferrie going into 544 Camp Street. In fact, Roach states in the interview that Oswald was seen going into the offices of Ferrie's group and that quote, "Oswald was known to be one of the men in the group."

And again, this is an investigative body of the United States government. And in the course of their routine surveillance of these anti-Castro Cubans, they pick up David Ferrie as part of their surveillance. And low and behold, they find Lee Harvey Oswald palling around with David Ferrie and Guy Banister. This is game set and match. We have the US government, like I said, an investigative body of the US government, now telling us as part of their routine surveillance, they've developed an association between Oswald, Ferrie, and Banister â€“ vindicating Jim Garrison once again.

**Len Osanic** And what was his quote when they first contacted him?

**Bill Davy** His quote was, "I've been waiting for you guys for 12 years." No one had tracked him down, reached out to him. I mean, I don't know if he reached out to anybody himself but he said, "Yeah, I've been waiting 12 years to talk to someone about this." So that's just shameful that it took that long to find this guy. I wish he had gone to Garrison's office when Garrison was at the peak of his investigation and had reported this to Garrison because who knows what would have happened from there.

**Len Osanic** It would have been a game changer, right?

**Bill Davy** Exactly. Game changer because Roach goes on to say, quote, "Garrison had something. I read his reports in the newspaper and they were correct. He received good intelligence information." And he went on to note, "Garrison was all eyes and ears in the French Quarter." So he knew Garrison was on to something, and he had the evidence himself.

**Len Osanic** Now the other thing that I didn't know too much about that you went into great detail is "phase one" and "phase two" and maybe you can just give a brief overview of that because it's all in your video but the phase two is really informative for all the people that say, well, going in and attacking Castro, all these things were Kennedy's plan and it was Kennedy's plan or it was Bobby Kennedy. Now we find out that neither of them knew about it.

**Bill Davy** Neither of them knew. And before I go into that Len, can I just go back one second-

**Len Osanic** Sure, no problem. Go ahead.

**Bill Davy** To Roach again. Yeah. One of the other things he revealed was when Oswald got into that street scuffle with Carlos Bringuier, handing out the pro-Castro literature and was arrested by the New Orleans PD. As we know from history and from various research, Oswald was picked up by the NOPD, taken down to the station and asked to speak to an FBI agent and they called in the FBI agent quickly and so forth. That was a little suspicious in and of itself, but what Roach told the Church Committee adds a little extra flavor to that, something I don't think anybody has ever noted before. And that was when the NOPD picked him up, Oswald was only speaking Russian. And the New Orleans Police Department came to the conclusion that he was Russian. So they called the INS who would have had jurisdiction over a Russian alien in the country.

**Bill Davy** One of Roach's colleagues, a guy named Smith, went down to the NOPD and they brought him into the interrogation room there and Smith says, "We know this guy. He's an American." So once the jig was up, and once Oswald had been outed, he knocked off the Russian, started speaking English and that's when he asked to speak to the FBI and John Quigley came down and he and Oswald talked. So that was another thing that I felt added a little extra dimension to the Oswald in New Orleans story that we had never heard before. And by the way, this information, as best as I can tell, was never followed up on by the Church Committee and was never transitioned over to the House Select Committee investigators. So it just languished there and as far as I know, no one ever followed up on this piece of evidence or Wendell Roach again, which is shameful.

**Bill Davy** Getting back to your original question, you wanted to talk a little bit about the phase one and phase two Castro plots.

**Len Osanic** Also, I just want to let you know that feel free to add anything. I know you briefly spoke about Wendell Roach and you showed documents to support this, but if you have anything else to add, I don't mind just going there.

**Bill Davy** Okay, okay. I just wanted to cover that bit about the Russia, Oswald speaking Russian. But at any rate, yeah, the CIA commissioned their own inspector general investigation and report on the Castro assassination plots. This was in the late '60s, around the time the Garrison investigation was just heating up and it was actually a column in the Washington Post by Drew Pearson that they said was actually the impetus or the catalyst for this internal investigation. But nevertheless, the main investigator was an attorney named Scott Breckenridge, who later shows up as a CIA liaison with the House Select Committee, but at any rate the church committee interviewed Breckenridge. And as the main author and investigator of the IG report, he was pretty good, pretty important witness for them.

**Bill Davy** The bottom line was, they issued this internal report on the Castro assassination plots and they do mention the history of it. There was a phase one that preceded Kennedy and was supposedly shut off. And then there was a phase two, which approximately started around, say, April of 1962 in which neither Robert Kennedy or the president had authorized. This is more of the William Harvey, ZR Rifle plots that most people or researchers are familiar with. That's the phase two. Both of these, phase one and phase two, involved CIA using the mafia and/or other unsavory types such as some Corsican mobsters and so forth. Anyway, this is William Harvey's plan.

**Bill Davy** So when they ... they, the CIA, finally got around to informing Bobby Kennedy about the plots, they had told him this was Richard Helms, they told him that phase one had been switched off, it was finished and did not inform Bobby Kennedy of phase two, which was in fact ongoing at the time. And that is in the CIA's own inspector general report. That there was no authorization from President Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, or McCone, by the way, who was the Director of Central Intelligence. In fact, at one point the counsel for the Church committee asks Breckenridge, if Mr. McCone had been advised that the agency was engaged in efforts specifically to assassinate Mr. Castro, in your judgment, what would Mr. McCone have done? And he goes on to say, he would have stopped the plot. So they withheld the information from McCone because they didn't want him putting the brakes on the Castro assassination plots.

**Bill Davy** So from the director on up, McCone, Bobby Kennedy, the President, none of them knew or had given any authorization to assassinate Castro. And that's coming from the CIA's own inspector general report.

**Len Osanic** So it kind of shows the weakness or poverty when Robbie Kennedy phones McCone right after his brother's assassinated and asks, "What have you found? Is it one of your guys?" And you know, McCone's out of the loop.

**Bill Davy** Yeah, is it one of your guys? Exactly. McCone's so out of the loop. He could say no but what does he know? Right? By the way, one of the things that was revealed by Breckenridge in this interview was that these phase one plots were supposed to be coincidental. Some of these phase one plots are supposed to be coincidental with the Bay of Pigs. In other words, the Bay of Pigs was almost contingent, or was contingent upon them infiltrating assassins into Cuba and bumping off Castro, which never happened and by the way, was never approved of by the president or even told to the president that this was part of the Bay of Pigs operation. Like I said, phase one started before Kennedy even got into office. He also talks about how they tried to infiltrate this one assassin three times to get into Cuba and assassinate Castro. Prior to the Bay of Pigs, by the way. And he was unsuccessful, obviously, but this just goes to show you the level of activity that was taking place to assassinate Castro, which either preceded Kennedy or Kennedy knew nothing about.

**Len Osanic** Well, for sure, he knew nothing about it because they admit that.

**Bill Davy** Yep. It's right in-

**Len Osanic** And his brother. And it was withheld because they knew what his reaction would. It's not like an oversight, in my opinion.

**Bill Davy** Exactly. No, no. They knew exactly what the reaction would be. And they knew what McCone's reaction would be. So they withheld. They withheld all that information.

**Len Osanic** Another item you brought up about Richard Helms was this discussion about, you brought up some documents about assassinations, they will not change governments. And that was a report, if you can briefly get into that because I think at one point the question I had for you was, you said Helms was mad at this, he didn't like this report, its conclusions. And I wanted to get your ... if you could elaborate on that point but maybe just briefly bring up the topic what we're gonna get into.

**Bill Davy** Yeah. One of the conclusions of the IG report was that assassinations of heads of state do not necessarily change that state's government anyway, so they're almost useless. Helms didn't like that. He wanted that conclusion and that passage excised from the final IG report because he disagreed. He liked assassinations. He felt that assassinations were the way to go if you wanted to change the direction of a state's government.

**Len Osanic** Okay, since we're right there, what gives you that opinion then? How do we know that he didn't like it?

**Bill Davy** How do we know what, that Helms didn't like it?

**Len Osanic** Yeah, I mean you're saying that, right? You're stating that.

**Bill Davy** It's in Breckenridge's sworn testimony that after they submitted the final report to Helms, Helms blew up, went after Breckenridge and Inspector General Earman, I think his name was. And said to those guys, "Look I want this passage eliminated and excised." And they wouldn't do it, but that's part of Breckenridge's testimony to the Church committee.

**Len Osanic** Great. I didn't know that. So that's in stone then, all right. Because that's the idea that you think, well, if we you know, what's the Cuban government gonna be like if we just get rid of Castro and nothing changes? I mean, they're hoping that by bumping off Castro, something changes.

**Bill Davy** Yeah. They'd get another Batista in there. But it wasn't gonna work out that way.

**Len Osanic** Also, you could wonder about the American government you know, by saying, well, if we bump off Kennedy, things are gonna stay the same. We're gonna have Lyndon Johnson and this government of the old boy network back in power. So it could be by bumping off Kennedy, nothing too bad happens to America.

**Bill Davy** Yeah, well you see from the testimony here, Helms felt differently and thought that by assassinating a head of state it would change the course of government so he was all for that.

**Len Osanic** Because with one move you could initiate such a change. Okay, all right, good. That's what I just wanted to bring up and I didn't know that that testimony was there I haven't seen that.

**Bill Davy** Yeah, yeah.

**Len Osanic** And like I say, I know an awful lot about it and yet there's an awful lot I still don't know.

**Bill Davy** Yeah, I mean I'm still finding stuff. Like this Roach stuff was all new to me. I wish I had known earlier, I would have put it in my book. It's not in my book because I found this after the fact so yeah, there's still a lot out there that we probably haven't mined yet.

**Len Osanic** And when was the Scott Breckenridge interview conducted?

**Bill Davy** 1975.

**Len Osanic** So wow, to other people this old news but to us it's brand new.

**Bill Davy** Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well they didn't release this Breckenridge interview until they released all those Church Committee files and I don't know what year that was but this was buried somewhere in the bowels of the archives with the Church Committee file.

**Len Osanic** Right and you have to be pretty dedicated to start reading all the stuff they release.

**Bill Davy** Right. You got to know what to look for first and then you've got to read the material like this interview with Breckenridge I think is about 260 pages long. Pretty detailed.

**Len Osanic** Where would you find that today?

**Bill Davy** The AARC and I think the Mary Ferrell Foundation. They put out a CD-ROM a few years ago with the Church Committee report and its volumes and various files on a CD-ROM. That's actually where I got this stuff up out of. And it may be online at the Mary Ferrell website, I don't know but I got it from the CD-ROM that was, again, I'm pretty sure it was put out by the Assassination Archives and well the AARC and I think in conjunction with Mary Ferrell but don't quote me a hundred percent on that. But it's out there on CD-ROM.

**Len Osanic** Since I thought highly of your lecture, I was gonna ask you how did you organize it? When you decided to talk about the topic for an hour, how did you lay it out? Do you have any comments about that, insight?

**Bill Davy** Well, I laid it out in the way that we spoke about before. I thought it out with the conclusions of the House Select Committee and took the audience through that. And then at the end of that piece of it, does that remind you of anybody? Jim Garrison. Oh, by the way, further vindication from the government of Jim Garrison, comes in the form of the Church Committee files and then I go into the Wendell Roach stuff, and then it kind of switched gears a little bit but staying with the Church Committee files and in addition to the Roach material, in the Church Committee files is the interview with Scott Breckenridge about the IG report on the Castro assassination plots.

**Bill Davy** And so I take the audience through that and then we talk a little bit about the ZR Rifle information and how I found a little bit of information on ZR Rifle and how it predated JFK, actually. That's another thing that people have been trying to hang on President Kennedy or RFK was well, they came up with this ZR Rifle program, they wanted this executive action program. And there was a lot of collective amnesia going on during the time of these committees about who authorized what, et cetera. But, as I go through in my presentation, I found files related to ZR Rifle where they're talking about the CIA, talking about getting together with some quote unquote, "upper echelon hoodlums" as part of this ZR Rifle program and this is from 1959. This is before Kennedy's even running for office. This is part of a CIA review of the ZR Rifle master file and some of these early files came up and that was one of them. Another ZR Rifle financial folder was part of this review and it's dated October 1960, before President Kennedy was even elected. So we have documentary evidence, again, from the CIA's own files that these ZR Rifle plots predate President Kennedy.

**Bill Davy** So I went through that and then from there, kind of switched gears a little bit and talked a little bit about Hale Boggs and how he was not such an advocate of the Warren Commission, not such a critic I should say, of the Warren Commission as has been portrayed and he certainly was no advocate of Jim Garrison's. And went into that a little bit and then went a little bit about how the FBI had an informant incorporated into the CBS special that they ran in 1968. And then just finished up with some information on Earl Warren and that was pretty much how I wrapped it up.

**Len Osanic** Yeah, very interesting and very informative and it seems like there's still a lot more information out there for people to dig up and go through and then analyze and put in perspective.

**Bill Davy** Yes, sorry to interrupt but yeah, all this information was right from the Intelligence Agency's own files whether it's the INS or the Church Committee or CIA or the FBI. All this information I used was strictly in the file releases with the exception of the two slides I did on Earl Warren at the end, which is from a Vanity Fair article and another from a Life Magazine. The rest are all, I did 40 plus slides, was all documents, all documented from the CIA or the FBI or the Church Committee's own documents.

**Len Osanic** Now, I don't know if you had any time constraints. Is there anything that you didn't get to bring up in your presentation that you ... I mean, I'd give you time to talk about now.

**Bill Davy** No, I got to everything that I wanted to talk about. I was mindful of other people's time because we were running a little bit behind but I got in everything I wanted to talk about. But, now that you mention it, I think you're gonna have Jim DiEugenio on a little bit later and he's probably gonna talk about this Ken Burns Vietnam special.

**Len Osanic** Yeah, go ahead yep.

**Bill Davy** And I don't know if Jim will bring this up, I imagine he probably will, but in the course of my studies and looking at some of the files relative to JFK and Vietnam, one of the most important files in there is the minutes from the SecDef conference in May of 1963, SecDef standing for Secretary of Defense and McNamara held these conferences throughout the years. And the one he held in May of '63 in Hawaii was very interesting. As you read the minutes of the meeting, McNamara is chastising the generals because the withdrawal plan is going too slow. He and the president wanted to speed it up. The withdrawal plan. So we're talking about Kennedy withdrawing the American advisors out of Vietnam. The plan was a thousand home by Christmas '64 and the rest out after that.

**Bill Davy** In addition to that, in the SecDef minutes, there is a bar graph that shows the fiscal year funding for Vietnam operations. And you can see from this bar graph a steady decline as each fiscal year goes on. Now, does that look like somebody who's trying to escalate the war or deescalate when you see the funding? And it's clearly represented on this bar graph and the bars are going down each fiscal year.

**Bill Davy** On top of that, in the book, in the film Virtual JFK, McGeorge Bundy's biographer reveals that in his interviews with McGeorge Bundy before he died, McGeorge Bundy was the national security advisor for JFK by the way. Bundy told him that President Kennedy was going to recognize China in his second term, something that Nixon did later, but President Kennedy was going to recognize China in his second term. Now, do you think a president that's about to recognize China in his second term is going to get into a land war and a shooting war with a bunch of Asians? I don't think so. It doesn't make sense from the diplomatic record that we have and the minutes from the SecDef conference with the graphs showing the funding going down and McNamara chastising the generals for the withdrawal being too slow. It's unequivocal. The President, President Kennedy, was withdrawing. There's no doubt.

**Bill Davy** But you won't find that mentioned in Burns' documentary, by the way. I haven't seen it, but from what I've heard, there's not even any mention in it of NSAM 263 and 273. How do you even have a discussion about Vietnam and not even mention NSAM 263 and 273? It's ridiculous. And you know what I'm talking about with those NSAMs, well, you've had enough conversations with Fletcher to know what's in those documents.

**Len Osanic** Right.

**Bill Davy** That's the Vietnam war, right there.

**Len Osanic** Yeah in 273 we're going to help the Vietnamese to win. Before it said we were going to help and supply, it didn't say we're going to help them to win.

**Bill Davy** Yeah. Basically, 263 was a thousand troops home by Christmas, withdrawal, deescalation. 273 was escalation of the Vietnam War. I mean, if you want to put it in a nutshell. And there is no discussion, from what I understand, in this documentary of that. How do you even have a reasonable discussion of the Vietnam War and not even bring that up? Mind boggling.

**Len Osanic** Well, that's why we discuss it here.

**Bill Davy** Exactly. Exactly. You've got to come to alternative news sites to get your information. Hate to use that word alternative news or alternative facts but you can't rely on corporate sponsored media to get the truth out, that's for damn sure.

**Len Osanic** Yeah, and that's the failing and of course, as you mentioned, people covering Jim Garrison trial and covering what you think are the facts. So what if there was two lone shooters shooting? You know, so what? I mean-

**Bill Davy** Yeah. Two lone nuts.

**Len Osanic** Oh, God, it's unbelievable but that's printed.

**Bill Davy** Yeah.

**Len Osanic** Well, very good presentation you did. I'm gonna include it as part two it's gonna be under Black Op Radio YouTube as well so people can watch it. There's a lot of documents. You show the documents, so when you're talking about some of these items that people say, "Well, show me the document." Here it is, right? I'm gonna try to see if we can't find a link to that Scott Breckenridge ... you said it's about 200 pages?

**Bill Davy** Yeah, it is.

**Len Osanic** I haven't read that, so I'm interested in that because it sounds like there'd be an awful lot there.

**Bill Davy** There is, there's a lot of good information in there.

**Len Osanic** Are you optimistic about what's going to be released in the fall here? If it's released?

**Bill Davy** No.

**Len Osanic** Okay.

**Bill Davy** No, not based on ... if they're teasing us with what they've released so far, then no, I'm not very optimistic about it. How about you?

**Len Osanic** I'm just neutral. I'm just waiting to see what's out there, you know?

**Bill Davy** Yeah.

**Len Osanic** I think one writer-

**Bill Davy** But you've seen what's come out so far, right?

**Len Osanic** Well, I haven't read it all. I was very disappointed when I tried to play the audio of the [Cinqo 00:39:56], it sounded like it was recorded in another room down a hallway and two guys arguing or something like that. It was so bad. And I think it's about five or six hours of it. I played about a minute of it and said, "You kidding me? I'm not gonna listen for the ..." And they probably did that on purpose. They probably have a crystal clear recording of it and they leaked this.

**Bill Davy** Yeah. I think that [Cinqo 00:40:20] thing is a big red herring to get you off of other topics of import anyway.

**Len Osanic** Yeah like Ed Lansdale or like you say, Vietnam or withdrawals or Kennedy's opposition. Who really wanted him removed there? And one item, I mean, there's always a tidbit, that about Earle Cabell being a CIA asset, that came out, so that's of interest. I mean, even when they do release these things, they never really buttress or support anything about Lee Oswald, that's just more ammunition to let people know that, look, he had nothing to do with it. He had nothing to do with it. And here's all these investigations, which you're not allowed to see until 75 years later or whatever the case is.

**Bill Davy** Right, right. You ask yourself two simple questions. First, you ask, did the foreign policy of the United States change after President Kennedy's death? And if the answer to that is yes, then you have to ask yourself, was that an errant killing? And then you go from there. So it's very simple as far as figuring that out but then you get down the rabbit hole and you've got to wade through the disinformation and the misinformation. But hopefully manage to get some good information out in this presentation.

**Len Osanic** Well, very good. Well, I just wanted to bring up a couple of questions with you, which I did. I urge everyone to watch our part two, your presentation for Lee Shepherd, right? He put it on.

**Bill Davy** Yeah. He was [inaudible 00:42:15].

**Len Osanic** Right, good. And is there anything in the future planned for you? Are you going to be doing any other presentations?

**Bill Davy** Nothing in the immediate future and I think I mentioned on the last show we did that I'm working on a totally different venture this time in that I'm co-writing a biography with John Wall about his life and times as a rock and roll drummer as part of National Lampoon. So I think that will be a very interesting read once we get it out there.

**Len Osanic** Okay, good. Well thank you so much, Bill, for taking time to just elaborate on your lecture and it's so good, as I'm saying, I'm including. Anything else that I didn't get to you want to bring up at all?

**Bill Davy** No, that pretty much covers it, Len. I just thank you and appreciate the kind words.

**Len Osanic** Okay. Well, they're deserved. You know, I thought you did a really good job and if you've got an interest in the JFK assassination, you've got to watch Bill's presentation. Leave it at that for now. All right then, Bill, thank you again for being a part of Black Op Radio and just keep me in the loop, email me anytime there's something news worthy and I'll be glad to help discuss it with you.

**Bill Davy** You bet. Thanks a lot, Len.

**Len Osanic** All right. Good night.

**Bill Davy** Thank you. Good evening.

**Speaker 30** The Plot to Kill King by William Pepper. William Pepper was James Earl Ray's lawyer in the trial for the murder of Martin Luther King Junior and even after Ray's conviction and death, Pepper continues to adamantly argue Ray's innocence. This myth shattering exposÃ© is a revised, updated, and heavily expanded volume of Pepper's original bestselling and critically acclaimed book, Orders to Kill, with 26 years of additional research included. The result reveals dramatic new details of the night of the murder, the trail, and why Ray was chosen to take the fall for an evil conspiracy, a government sanctioned assassination of our nation's greatest leader. The plan, according to Pepper, was for a team of United States Army Special Forces snipers to kill King, but just as they were taking him, a backup civilian assassin pulled the trigger.

**Speaker 30** In The Plot to Kill King, Pepper shares the evidence and testimonies that prove that Ray was a fall guy chosen by those who viewed King as a dangerous revolutionary. His findings make the book one of the most important of our time. The uncensored story of the murder of an American hero that contains disturbing revelations about the obscure inner workings of our government and how it continues even today to obscure the truth.
