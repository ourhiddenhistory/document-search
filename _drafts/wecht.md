**Speaker 1** I am not going to take long. I want to move this along and try to catch up for some of the time we have fallen behind. I think it is listed in the program that it is medical or scientific practicing[inaudible 00:00:21] I'm not going give you my whole [inaudible 00:00:28] but let me just review. Probably most, if not, all of you are familiar with these points, there are maybe some of you that are not fully cognizant of some of the issues that I perceive from the perspective of a forensic pathologist.

**Speaker 1** Let me just say that I have been a forensic pathologist since 1961 my year of training end of '62 and I continue to practice ... I've done about 20,000 autopsies and I have and I have supervised and signed off on about 40,000 others, and I don't know how many thousands of these have been homicides and how many have involved gunshot wounds, which of course it the #1 form of homicide in this country.

**Speaker 1** Let's just hit some of the medical highlights and then you can put it together and then you will have a chance then, we all will with the speakers who are going to follow a lot of time on this. Let's just go back to the President's arrival of Parkland Hospital, about 18 physicians as I recall, quickly became assembled. They weren't all there at the moment that he arrived obviously but they quickly came. Keep in mind, Parkland Memorial Hospital is a major trauma center. These are doctors who have dealt with gunshot wounds hundreds and hundreds of times, and some of these were senior people. Among them, Dr. Kemp Clark, Professor of Neurosurgery, a distinguished experienced Neurosurgeon, textbook writer, and his young assistant at that time Robert Grossman who went on to become the chief ... My son spent 6 years there in neurosurgery and later on under Dr. Grossman. Dr. McClelland, I think many of you here have seen Dr. McClelland talk about this at our conference in Pittsburgh that my son Ben who is here organized. We had him live talking about this at a 2013 conference.

**Speaker 1** So, these are the physicians who were there, and at that time obviously they didn't know a damn thing. No matter what anybody may think, even the people with the loudest conspiracy thoughts one way or the other, obviously these are people fresh to the game. They had no dog in that race, I remember that great line from the JFK movie with Walter Mathieu. They called it as they saw it. What did they see, this array of prominent physicians? They described the wounds and we have this on video.

**Speaker 1** Our colleague Dr. Gary Argalar has a marvelous presentation, he shows one after the other of these physicians. Where were the injuries? They all talked about the occipital area. They all talk about it. They all talk about damage to the cerebellum, the cerebellum is that part of the brain that is located posteriorly and inferiorly that deals with coordination and balance. Back here. Do you think that these doctors knew about anatomy of the brain? Do you think a neurosurgeon knew the difference between cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum hemisphere? Could they all have been mistaken? This alone, shows you the bullshit that unfolded later on at Bethesda. This alone by itself tells you that. You start off with this. This can not be ignored.

**Speaker 1** So you have all of that in place and now we have the body at Bethesda [inaudible 00:04:44] audience of people among you ... not this audience necessarily, but when I talk to groups you are a microcosm of America and 20 to 30% of you still believe in the Warren Commission Report, and I want you to know then, what you are dealing with. I want you to know who the players on your team are. I want you to know that the 2 guys that did the autopsy on Kennedy, Humes and Boswell, career naval pathologists had never done a single gunshot wound autopsy in their entire careers, and I repeat that, for emphasis. I want you to think about that, democrat, republican, liberal, conservative, I don't care what you think, you have this ...

**Speaker 1** I love to give the analogy, let's say the President had slipped, that day, on a wet bathroom shower floor and struck his head and he was dazed, maybe he was rendered unconscious for a brief moment, and they say to an audience of lay people, okay sir who would you call in as an expert to evaluate the President under this hypothetical, metaphorical scenario that I present to you, a Neurosurgeon, a Neurologist, an Internist, want to check the cardiac respiratory status, you know a little about medicine, you say you want an ophthalmologist, look at the eye [inaudible 00:05:54] because an initial cranial bleed can be reflected in the ophthalmological examination.

**Speaker 1** What if under my hypothetical retrospective metaphor, the President slipping and striking his head, and you had to evaluate his brain condition and they called in a dermatologist, obstetrician, and gynecologist? How would you like that? Okay. When you deal with somebody with multiple gunshot wounds that is a difficult situation, and when you've got two people and you have to correlate wounds from one to the other and you have to establish trajectory and sequence and angle and the relationship of one to the other, this is a formidable mess.

**Speaker 1** The top forensic [inaudible 00:06:40] Milton Helpern, Chief Medical Examiner of New York City, he already had his bag packs. I know this from directly from Milton. It wasn't in an arrogant egotistical way but there is no question, it's the President, you got to call in the top guys and he already called in 2 or 3 of the top people in the country to join with him in forensic pathology at that time. Nobody in that group, none of those ever ever got a call, and why? There can only be one answer, because this is going to be a military operation. This is going to be a controlled situation. You could take a chance on some civilian forensic pathologist who has been 30, 40, 50 years in practice. Who has their entire reputation on the line, you are going to call them in and you are going to tell them what to do like they did with those people.

**Speaker 1** Now, when Pierre Finck came over, the 3rd guy from the Armed Force Institute of Pathology, the 1 of the 3 that I knew personally from my 2 years in the Air Force, when Pierre asked a couple of questions he was told damn quickly you just proceed doctor, we'll tell you. There were 33 people in that autopsy room during the course ... Some of which were 4 star Admirals and Generals and FBI and so on telling them what to do and what not to do. What did they see then? Well now this cerebellum is intact and there is no damage in the occipital area. How does that change? I throw it out to you. You don't have to be a doctor, a forensic psychologist, you explain that to me. I don't care how little you know about anatomy, you know the difference between frontal and occipital ... the difference between front and back. How do you explain that?

**Speaker 1** Okay, so now they put it to bed. Oh, by the way these great pathologists doing an autopsy, only on our President after all, they missed the gunshot wound on the President. When I say the size and they look at me, "What are you talking about?" They never knew there was a bullet wound in front of the neck on the night of the autopsy. They thought they were only seeing a tracheostomy, an incision into the windpipe that you use to take out CO2 and put in oxygen, suck out mucus and blood, and try to keep the person alive while you deal with the wounds and try to save his life, which of course was futile in this case but they missed that gunshot wound, they failed to talk with the doctors.

**Speaker 1** When the coroner, and all those years and still today, when I have an opportunity to talk to the Doctor Surgeon who is operating on somebody that has been shot or stabbed, I want to talk with that surgeon before I do the autopsy because they invariably, they will go through the wound, understandably, to try to get to the scene of the problem. Where is the hemorrhage? What do we have to do with the liver? What do we have to do with the spleen? What do we have to do with the lung and so on? They are not going to get into all kinds of exploratory diagnostic procedures, so you go through the wound and then, not deliberately or malevolently but it will be obfuscated, it will be changed, it will be altered. Here are these guys, and they had all the time in the world, don't forget right? What do we have 7 or 8 hours from Dallas to D.C.? You got a lot of time, touch base man, touch base! Never was done.

**Speaker 1** The next morning they learned they had missed a gunshot wound on the President after their report has been submitted to President Johnson and FBI Director Hoover, and I love to say this to an audience, what do you do you do in a case like that, the next morning you find out that you missed the gunshot wound on the President of the United States. What do you do? If you're Asian, you commit suicide. If you're European, you resign. If you're American, you just bullshit your way out of it. That is exactly what the hell happened here, okay?

**Speaker 1** Now we proceed, everything is now in place, now we have the bullet coming out and everybody is quite sanguine and then low and behold they have a hell of a problem, now comes the Zapruder film 18.3 frames per second and now comes the test firing of the Mannlicher-Carcano, 2.3 seconds in the hands of the best marksmen they could find and you put them together but it doesn't work because, the Zapruder film clearly shows and I have never heard any argument on this, correct me my colleagues, or anybody else if I am wrong, I have never heard anybody dispute this, the time between the President's hit and Connelly's hit, is about 1.5 seconds. I am not talking about the head wound, the first hit was 1.5 seconds. Well, it takes 2.3 seconds as determined by the Zapruder film and that is what of course gave birth to the Single-bullet theory.

**Speaker 1** Arlen Specter, Junior Legal Council on the Warren Commission, bright guy, we became quite friendly over the years in fact I was very actively involved in Democratic politics and yet I endorsed him in his re-election campaign in 2004, when he won as a Republican and I endorsed him in again 2010 when he lost to the Democratic primary. I only mention that because ... I emphasis that I don't say these things to dump on Arlen Specter, in fact I praise him in a way that he, a young man, he's the one who came up with it. [inaudible 00:11:33] a formidable dilemma, a physical incongruity, how do you deal with this? That is what gave birth to the Single-bullet theory as Mark Lane, I think the first one to label it the Magic Bullet theory, a phrase that I use and others have to.

**Speaker 1** Here we get to the heart of the case medically then, 7 wounds and 2 men. I am not going to take the time now but ... well I will take the time. [crosstalk 00:12:00] Sit in this chair here. Jerry come on, there is a chair right in front here. Demonstrative evidence, okay. Here you are. Here you are. The bullet comes in to Kennedy, about 5 1/2 inches down here not up in the neck where Ford tried to move it. The bullet was right here. Now, there is Oswald, you see him up there, 6th floor windows. [crosstalk 00:12:25] The shot is coming from right to left, up downward, and back to front okay? Bullet comes in here. So, for Augers we got the bullet exiting here and there is .. and my 8 colleagues on the House Select Committee of Assassination Forensic Pathology Panel, all agree there is no way to disagree that there is 11 1/2 degree upward angle. 11 1/2 degrees upward angle with a shot coming from the 6th floor. How did my colleagues get around ...

**Speaker 1** What if the President were bent over? Mr. President, don't tie your shoelace, you are in a god damn parade. [crosstalk 00:13:02] Stop scratching your groin [crosstalk 00:13:04] the people they love you. We got 11 degrees, okay. Now the bullet comes out [crosstalk 00:13:08] 30 inches between the President's chest and the Governor's back, 30 inches. Remember, downward or leftward. If it had grazed the Governor's front left shoulder, say well how do you know, an inch or 2 or so, but the bullet hit the Governor's right posterior axillary area, which is fancy medical terminology for the right armpit. Right over here. How in the hell .... I have seen these programs on T.V., here, or there, or there ... This is the alignment, look at the Zapruder film, they were both looking at the crime. The bullet hits the Governor there, goes through pierces the lung, destroys 4 inches of the 5th rib. John Connelly, 6'4", big boned Texan, you are not talking about some 110 pound woman here. It exits below the level of the nipple, Governor with the [inaudible 00:14:12] hat right here. Look at the Zapruder film. Don't believe me look at the Zapruder film. He's got the hat and he is looking at the people that love him. The bullet below the nipple level is going downward and the God damn bullet comes back all the way around, slams into the back of the wrist, shatters the distal end of the radius.

**Speaker 1** Now for those of you who are now physicians know the radius, 1 of the 2 bones in the forearm broadens just before just they meet the small bones of the wrist, broadens. This is a compound common unit fracture, not a grazing slightly displaced. This is a common unit, that bone is damaged badly. It comes out the front and now proceeds that angle this way was 27 degrees now a 45 degree angle until the 5. So, the bullet on the night of the autopsy that they found by, under the stretcher, on the stretcher, who knows whose stretcher, but in the emergency room the night of the autopsy the bullet was from Kennedy's back. Do you love this medically to of course... How did the bullet ... Remember they didn't know about the bullet exit wound and the throat. How did the bullet come out here? Well when the President lay on the table, supine, and they applied pressure to the front of his chest, the pressure applied to the front of his chest, forced the bullet that had gone deep inside of [inaudible 00:15:37] could not touch it with their finger, could not touch it with an instrument, and they did find it ....

**Speaker 1** So they go their information from the FBI that a bullet had been found, on, under, a stretcher, back of their apartment. Ahhh! Now we know, when they pressed on the chest, for a cardiac massage, the bullet came back out.

**Speaker 1** Bullets do not do that. There is not a car that you put in reverse and decide you're going the wrong way, and want to back up. It doesn't work that way. We gotta really go in and dig and look for bullets. The next day when we learned about the hole, and the President's neck, now the bullet is from the front of his neck, so his starched white collar, got frightened to death, popped in front of his clothing, and that's where the bullet came from. Five months later, under the single bullet theory, now the bullet is from the left thigh. Okay? Thanks.

**Speaker 1** That's the single bullet theory.

**Speaker 1** All right I'm going to wrap it up. I'm going to tell you this, here in Washington D.C., not far from here, I don't think, as a member of the Friends of Pathology Panel I gave my minority dissenting report to the distinguished house committee, they were all there, as I recall. I told them, what I said to my colleagues, and my colleagues are eight experienced, competent, forensic pathologists. I had sent them in, and I repeated to the committee, and I'll toss it out again now ... That was '78 right? So we're talking 22 and 16 is 38, 38 and a half years ago, I repeat the challenge: I said to my colleagues, and I said to the committee, "go back to your respective offices, search your files, don't limit it to just autopsies you've done, every pathologist in the office now, every pathologist who has ever been in that office since the office started, all the major medical examiner, coroner's offices in the country, anyone, and come up with one case, one case in which a single bullet produced seven wounds, multiple wounds, I wouldn't limit them to seven, broke two bones, and emerged pristine."

**Speaker 1** The bullet commission exhibit 399 is completely intact, there is only slight deformity at the base and there is a question of weather that, I always thought, maybe it came from the impact of the bullet being shot. In any event, the entire copper jacket is intact. Totally intact. The nose, the cone of the bullet, shows no deformity what so ever. I continue to look at the bullets that I extract from people when I do homicides, or that the police, the city police bring in, for me to look at. Bullets that just break a bone, sometimes bullets don't even break a bone, that are deformed, I have yet to see one such case. One such case.

**Speaker 1** That kind of summarizes it. I am not going to get into all of these other things on the head wound, I'll just tell you that a lot of work has been done. A lot of marvelous work Dr. David Nancy, who is a Ph.D, M.D., radiologist, physicist, Dr. Garry Agalar, Dr. Michael Cheshire, an outstanding neurologist who went there recently, and our good colleague, friend, Josiah, Ting, Thompson, and so on, are studying this etc. There is no way in the world, that the President received that shot in the rear, as the Warren Commission says, making a small identifiable hole in the right occiput and then moving forward to eventually[inaudible 00:19:40] the President was struck in the head twice, and one of the shots came from behind the third defense on the grassy knoll. That gives you the directionality, that gives you the impact, that gives you the reason why the motor cycle policeman riding off the left front wheel was spattered with brain and blood, so much that he thought he had been hit for several seconds. That's why the President, when he's struck, comes backward like this.

**Speaker 1** So, he's hit, you remember from your high school physics, force equals one half mass times velocity squared. One half mass times velocity squared. The bullet, in its pristine state, weighed 161 grains, 161 grains. The velocity by 121 feet per second. Figure that out. That impact to the head, according to the Warren Commission, the back of the head, but it drives him backward to the left, rather than forward. Then come these cop committees, Alvarez with his melons on the fence. So it's total bullshit, it's been shown to be absolutely absurd and fraudulent, just study this and read.

**Speaker 1** This bullet, as it was found, 158.6 grains, a loss of 2.4 grains is exactly one and a half percent of the original mass. This bullet producing seven wounds in two men, breaking two bones in a large boned man, looses only one and a half percent. I remember speaking with Audrey Bell?

**LarryAraschnapp** Yes.

**Speaker 1** The head nurse. I never met her, but I spoke with her and she told me, I remember her telling me. You get fragments from the surgeons operating on John Connolly, fragments, it's not big but she's got fragments which she gave to the FBI then. So all of those fragments, fragments with John Connolly took to the grave with him, we tried to get those and the Attorney General Janarillo was very cooperative and she passed on a request to the FBI, and then to Mrs. Connolly in D.C. to allow us to, somebody, a doctor to get out the fragment in his wrist. Unfortunately it was denied, but the point I make here now is, all those fragments together, according to the Warren Commission, quantitative to only one and a half percent of the original weight of that bullet.

**Speaker 1** Those are the medical facts. You deal with them, you follow through yourselves, you think them through, on these points and ask yourself weather or not the Warren Commission report and so far as the medical pathological evidence is the least bit credible. And that's the medical story.

**Speaker 1** Okay, does anybody have any questions about this?

**Speaker 1** Yes sir.

**Whole Audience** Doctor Whitt, I was president of the Miller Reporting Company

**Speaker 1** President of where sir?

**Whole Audience** Miller Reporting Company. Which did the the reportings, hearings, and depositions, for the assassination Rutgers Review Board. When you looked through Dr. Hughes' deposition, it's obvious that he's lying. And what's more the representatives from the review board knew that he was lying.

**Speaker 1** Thank you. Thank you.

**Speaker 1** Pierre Fink went back to native Switzerland and had been made inaccessible. My wife and I were talking last night about sometimes I'm in front of the work, other times I'm inaccessible. I knew Pierre Fink, you could not ... He was listed to [inaudible 00:23:25] academy of physical sciences as a member with no address and no phone number. I've contacted six friends who are pathologists in Switzerland and nobody knows anything about him. He just left the country, I'll never forget, seeing him at the American Academy Forensic Sciences in 1965, I gave my paper and sat next to him at lunch and said, Pierre, can you talk about it? And he was so, so, so distraught, so solemn. This was a guy who knew a little bit about forensic pathology and I'm sure what happened was just absolutely sickened him.

**Speaker 1** Yes Ma'am?

**Whole Audience** I just wanted to mention there is one more witness for your occipital wound. Tom Robinson worked at Gawler's Funeral Home and they were called up to the Feds in Mabel, he describes putting plaster pears in the right rear of the head and an rubber patch, just to seal it off.

**Speaker 1** To seal it off?

**Whole Audience** Yes.

**Speaker 1** But according to the Warren Commission, it's intact.

**Speaker 1** Thank you.

**Whole Audience** You can add him to your list. Tom Robinson at Gawler's.

**Speaker 1** Thank you very much Ma'am. Thank you.

**Speaker 1** Yes sir?

**Whole Audience** I was wondering, have you ever heard the theory that there was alterations done to the body ...

**Speaker 1** Yes.

**Whole Audience** On the airplane?

**Speaker 1** Yes. I have heard that, and a lot of the facts have been presented. Lifton, of course, I think was first and foremost ... There have been several other people who ... This gets into a very murky area, not aside from somethings missing. I forgot to mention the missing brain. When I finally got one of them to add medically, as it relates to me, I finally got in ... They came up with this cockamany executive agreement with Jackie Kennedy that she was the owner of everything, she was the owner of the gun, the rifle, the bullets, the bullet fragments, the X-rays, the clothing, she was the owner. And of course the last person in the world, I'm sure, who would ever look or touch any of that stuff, and then she gives it back to the government in a paper roll of 65.

**Speaker 1** In October of '66 they go in to do an inventory on Mrs. Kennedy's gift, and the agreement said that nobody could get in to see that for 75 years with exception that they recognized an expert in the field of pathology with a serious historical interest could apply. So I applied five years later in 1971 and I never got an answer back from Burk Marshall who was the executor of that agreement as Assistant Attorney General, and who now, in 1971, was a professor of law at Yale Law School.

**Speaker 1** I did get a response finally, once day I got a call from Fred Graham at the New York Times and he asked me, was it true that I was trying to get in, I said yes, and he said, well I'll check back with you. He called me back a a couple weeks later and asked me if I'd heard anything, I told him no, and I'll never forget his comment, not said in an arrogant way but just ... he said do you mind? And he asked me, he said do you mind if I call professor Marshall, he said, sometimes people do respond to the New York Times. I'll never forget that. I said yes, and finally I heard from Burk Marshall and he still tried to drag me around and told me why don't I come up to New Haven to meet with him. Little did he know that New Haven is our second home with my relatives and close friends there, I was elated to go to New Haven and visit family and friends, and finally I got permission.

**Speaker 1** So I go in, and I'm looking at all of this stuff and I have the stuff there, the comparison, and in April '65 we have all these things including a metal box that clearly contained the President's brain, and now in October of '66, that is no longer there. That was a front page story on August 27th of 1972, Fred Graham New York Times President's brain missing. And as we talk here today, the President's brain remains missing.

**Speaker 1** Yes sir?

**Whole Audience** Just a little back story here that I've written about, and not very many people know, was that when Fred Graham was given access to [inaudible 00:27:52] the public urologist of ... [crosstalk 00:27:55]

**Speaker 1** A urologist.

**Whole Audience** Yeah a urologist. And that was a big front page story and the Times got so much push back on that from professionals who were outraged that they were putting ... calling a urologist an expert in this case. That's why Fred Graham at the time, they actually were furious because they felt embarrassed, and that's why Fred Graham took it upon himself to get you in there.

**Speaker 1** Well good, I'm glad to hear that.

**Speaker 1** Well I am going to stop here, because we got to continue on. Folks, if any of you wish to talk to me later on privately please.

**Speaker 1** So at this time I want to introduce one of the members of the Cabinet Board of Directors, a practicing attorney in New York city who I respect, who has done a tremendous amount of work on this case with us, and who has acquired a great degree of background knowledge. Jim Hosar, whom you have already heard from and whom I introduced earlier. I'm going to turn over this portion of the program and introduce to you at this time Attorney Araschnapp.

**LarryAraschnapp** Andrew?

**MC** Yup.

**LarryAraschnapp** Can you give me a five minute and a two minute?

**MC** Yup.

**LarryAraschnapp** Okay 15 minutes. Okay, all right, okay.

**LarryAraschnapp** I'm Araschnapp, I'm co-chair of the Patho-Legal Committee and I'll tell you shortly what we're doing. Before I start, just curious, how many people in this room consider themselves part of the media? Oh good. Okay.

**LarryAraschnapp** What I'm going to talk about is why the JFK assassination is still important today, and also what we're going to be doing, from a legal stand point to try to shed some light on this case. Just to let you know I'm the [inaudible 00:29:44] of the New York State Bar Association and when I told my colleagues I was coming down here this evening to see why you're wasting your time to ... waste your time on the Kennedy assassination, when we have so many pressing modern issues to deal with.

**LarryAraschnapp** Lo and behold, on my way down this morning, when I was flying down, obviously seat 6B and in seat 6A was Donald Trump Jr. So I spent 45 minutes talking about departmental issues to Donald Trump Jr. So I'm accomplishing both of my goals.

**LarryAraschnapp** So the Warren Commission was the original fake news, that he had turned to facts. People that believe in the Warren Commission's conclusions are the equivalent of today's climate deniers. Why do I say that? Because Warren Commission's conclusions was base largely on evidence that would not have been admissible in a court of law, they typically overstated the evidence as to what was really said, they cherry picked evidence and exaggerated what it meant, they failed to disclose exculpatory information. They failed to procure leads that would have led to exculpatory information. They bullied witnesses, in fact, it's really interesting with the doctors, to see how many times they go off the record. Whenever witnesses start going down the wrong road, lawyers know what to do. There's a lot of ... you'll see, whenever they go off the record so many things corrected.

**LarryAraschnapp** So they bullied witnesses, they actually changed testimony, from when it was unsworn, then it goes into the record and it's different. They declined to call witnesses who had adverse, or had information that would be contrary to the facts they were trying to sell, particularly with Connelly's ... The doctor in charge of Connelly's surgery and some other doctors that had information that ... The questions weren't asked that would have been detrimental to the single bullet theory. Many of the potentially exculpatory information is now hidden behind dogma secrecy. We're hoping that some of this comes out this year.

**LarryAraschnapp** Even Jesse Curry, who was in charge of the investigation said in his 1969 book that they were unable to put Oswald on the sixth floor at the time at 12:30, at the time of the shooting, firing that rifle. You'll often see every time someone comes up with something contrary, the components of the Warren Commission [inaudible 00:32:31] we'll call it not credible evidence, well that gets us into the press and the press this year, this election cycle was really illustrative of both the press and our institutions. The press was clearly in a bubble, just like the press in 1963 was in a Cold War bunker. They called it "press of 1963 with supporting institutions of this country," again, in the cold war. Th press this time around is in an elite bubble it's in the ... I was a journalist, by the way, before I was a lawyer. Well it wasn't really newspaper, I wasn't a paper journalist. When I got to be where I wanted to be by 27, I decided to go to law school. Law school was always full back in those days for boys of my generation.

**LarryAraschnapp** There are a couple of journalistic or media theories out there one is known as "the open window" the other one is known as the "Halenshpere", basically it's what the media decides what is a consensus, what is reasonable dispute, and what is deviance. What we're seeing in this generation ... I'm also saying with the millennial lawyers as well, there seems to be this fear of sticking your neck out. We're seeing a lot of group think, what ever you want to call it, group think, pack mentality, conventional wisdom, consensus, but the reporters tend to not want to go outside of the normal realm. Now sometimes it's that the Charlie Roses and the Chis Matthews in the world don't want to antagonize their sponsors, some don't want to go to the parties that they get invited to, they're afraid that if they appear to be an outlier they won't get invited to the parties. What the result of this thinking is, is that anyone that ... People that are serious JFK researchers are kind of looked at as Hilary's deplorables, they are called conspiracy theorists, or busts. But there's a lot of serious people out here, and the reason I'm here is because I believe there is a real concern about our country, and that the same things that happened in 1963 are happening now.

**LarryAraschnapp** It used to be said that people that believe in a conspiracy can't accept the fact that a nobody killed the president, took down the president. What's really, I think is, the issue, is that people can't accept that in this country, something like this could have happened. We look at page 1986 to 1988 of Vincent Bugliosi's book, and he tells is right there. If there was a conspiracy what does is it say about the United Sates of America? It means we're no different from the Europeans, that we're like a Banana Republic. This is about protecting the institutions of this country, and that's why I will give LBJ the benefit of the doubt, and say in 1963, it was probably an understandable cover up because there was a fear of going to war and our European allies were nervous, it was the height of the Cold War, and I can understand maybe in those days, keeping the secrets away from our citizens. But 50 years later? I mean if Oswald truly was a lone assassin, as Jeff Morley said earlier today, why are the files still being held? What is there to hide?

**LarryAraschnapp** There analogies, but let me ... Something that's actually right on point is the Cruz Father story, this is a classic example of how the media has been misreporting the Kennedy assassination from day one. First of all Chris Matthews and Rachel Maddow, or even the people on Fox, said that Donald Trump said the Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. He did not say that, he said that Ted Cruz's father was with Oswald in New Orleans in August when he was handing out the pamphlets. He said nothing about being involved in the Kennedy assassination, but that's how it was reported. They missed the real story though. The real story is we don't know who was around Oswald, why don't we know? Were they exiles, or were they real Cubans? Oswald was reportedly handing out supporting free Cuba leaflets. We have reason to believe that the people around him were Cuban Exiles, and why don't we know? Because everything is hidden.

**LarryAraschnapp** That's the real story, that's what the press should have been investigating. Why don't we know that four people standing around Oswald? And they missed that story completely because of their group think. It was, Donald Trump is crazy, he's calling Ted Cruz's father a conspiracist. It means Donald Trump is not qualified to be President. It was his bias, and that's what the press did through out this campaign. The press was chasing profits and they raised Donald Trump up in the primary, when they could have done all those investigations they did later on, but they didn't do that.

**LarryAraschnapp** Let's turn to Hillary. Hillary and the emails, what does that tell us? There has been a pattern in this country now of government employees trying to prevent creating government records. It may have been in the 1960's and what we're discovering during this process with the board, was that government records were being destroyed, or being over classified so they can't be disclosed. We have some of that now as well, obviously Hillary's emails, there was a dispute about what was truly security and what was not. What we're having is, instead of having a greater transparency as Obama said on day one of his administration, he was going to be one of the most transparent government ever. We have people at all levels of government create using private emails, why? Because they don't want to create government records that are subject to FOIA.

**LarryAraschnapp** I have it, we have it in New York. In New York up until six months ago, Governor Cuomo had a rule that government emails could be destroyed in 30 days. When I talk to people in EPA and they have private emails, I say how do you what records are government records, how do we decide which ones they are? So we're having a culture of secrecy, now what they're trying to do is not create government records because then they don't have to worry about destroying them.

**LarryAraschnapp** The FBI. The FBI was in charge of the Warren Commission investigation, it was clearly a politicized investigation. Hoover was in charge of it. What happened this time around? The FBI was still interfering with our political campaign. Now I'm a republican, a Ted Roosevelt republican. Okay? So I'm not some JFK far left democrat that loves JFK. I'm not coming from that direction, so when I say these things, know where I'm coming from, and know I was a former journalist.

**LarryAraschnapp** So we have politicization of our institutions and it's still going on. Combie says no reasonable prosecutor would have commenced an action, well he's going to say that the Warren Commission did. They decided ... They became the prosecutor. That wasn't Combie's role to decide if he was a prosecutor or not, that was a department of justice decision.

**LarryAraschnapp** You know that today's refugees, the equivalent to the 1960's were the Cubans. Cubans were the refugees in the early '60s, one out of ten Cuban refugees were Castro agents. We would have been in the same situation with our refugees today as with them. A lot of the Cuban exiles were very hostile, they had extremely violent groups. So we would be still back in the same situation occurring now. Today's terrorists was the 1960's communists. We are doing the same thing that we did then. Think about this also, Donald Trump probably has the greatest ... probably has the most hostile relationship with the national security apparatus as JFK. The next person would have been Nixon. We know what happened to JFK, Nixon, once he started threatening the CIA about opening up the Bay of Pigs thing, they took him down. So I'm really worried about, whether you like Donald Trump or not, I'm concerned about where this is going. Everything is still in place.

**LarryAraschnapp** This is what we're going to do. Kapp is obviously pushing to open up the records, so we're going to do everything we can, whether it's public events like this, whether it's going to be legal actions against the national archives. We're also, going to be conducting a mock trial at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, November 16th and 17th, a two day trial. We're going to do what's never been done before. Now there have been four mock trials by the way, since the JFK assassination. Yale Nights in 1967, resulted in a hung jury, in 1986 was the televised trial with Vincent Bugliosi and Hayseed Spencer, he wasn't prepared for the trial and that resulted in a conviction. In 1992 the ADA had a two day trial which resulted in a hung jury. In 2013 the Dallas Bar Association had a trial, a one day trial, resulted in a hung jury. So the only time there has been a conviction, in a mock trial, has been the 1986 case with Spencer and Bugliosi.

**LarryAraschnapp** What none of them have done is the classic criminal case, which is ... We're going to go through the evidence. We're going to go through the hulls that were found on the sixth floor, the bullet fragments the magic bullet. We're going to get a 3-D scanner, we're going to scan the tool marks on the bullets to see if they really do link back to the rifle. We're going to look at the hair fibers we're going to look at the paper bag. We're going to look at it as if this was a real trial ... Which evidence would be admissible which, evidence would not be admissible.

**LarryAraschnapp** We think, we're hoping to get Marina Oswald to come in, to testify, to set the historic record straight, you have to ... She is to me a sympathetic figure. She was a 23 year old mother her husband was just murdered, she's not a citizen, and she has a choice. She has a classic Sophie's choice, does she tell the truth about her dead husband, or does she protect her babies and tell the government, well she's afraid of the government from where she came, does she tell the government what they want to hear. So, what we're hoping to do, we believe that we have a basis to establish that the Oswald was not convictable, much less not indictable.

**LarryAraschnapp** If we're successful and we can establish that, in this two day trial ... Dr. Wags is going to be on the day two, the day one is going to be a straight ... This started off really as a, you have to think about this ... This begins as a cop killer case. Oswald allegedly shoots Tippit, and you know when you shoot a cop, you know what all the cops are going to do. They're going to do whatever they can to get that guy, right? Then it suddenly becomes the assassination of the President. So if there was planted evidence, it was probably it was probably planted to make sure there is a conviction on Tippit. This is inside. There is a proceeding in Texas known as court of inquiry. It's a real legal procedure that you can file at anytime, and if we're successful in this mock trial, we are going to bring a real legal proceeding in Texas, on behalf of the Doyers of the Oswalds, to expunge the stain of their father's name from their name, and try to expunge his arrest record. He wasn't convicted, but he was arrested. So that's what we're going to do in November we're going to be doing the mock trial.

**LarryAraschnapp** How much time do I have?

**MC** A couple more minutes.

**LarryAraschnapp** That's pretty vague.

**LarryAraschnapp** All right, so we're going to do the mock trial, we're going to have it videoed and we are probably going to have to race some money because we're going to have some expert witnesses. We actually have the people who did the Thayer analysis from the 1992 mock trial that Hosner actually used, he only asked for the prosecution side of the file, I have the defense file as well.

**LarryAraschnapp** Apparently when the did the trajectory cone the first time, it actually focused on the Dal Tex building. We are not trying to figure out who killed the president. That's not our job, we don't have subpoena power. We are just going to show that Lee Oswald was not the shooter, the lone shooter, or not the shooter at all. That's what we hope to prove.

**LarryAraschnapp** That is what Kapp is going to do in November, we hope that members of the press will follow this mock trial, Bob Tanenbaum who is the Deputy Council to the House of Assassinations Committee is on our defense team. We will by April know who the prosecution, and who the judge is. We will have a jury, and it's going to be a full fledged two day trial, and we would like you to support us because we need to pay for some of our experts. The lawyers are doing this pro bono, we believe in this so much, I'm taking time off my busy private law practice to do this. We hope to use this mock trial to show the alternative facts and the junk science, the Warren Commission was the original junk science case. We're going to try to prove that.

**LarryAraschnapp** So with that I'll turn out to one of the most historic figures in the legal sector of the JFK assassinations. Mr. Jim Hosar.

**Jim Hosar** Now, historic, I don't know about that. My claim to fame with regard to the JFK Act was that I testified before something like three different congressional committees. That they should pass the JFK Act because I had lost all my cases. I think that it's probably true that zero ... Someone remarked earlier about whether or not I had handled more cases related to assassination cases than anyone else, and I think the answer is that I've both won more, and lost more than anyone else. I've handled over 200 Freedom of Information Act cases in my career, a large number of them representing very dedicated scholars and researchers.

**Jim Hosar** My organization for example is comprised of lawyers, doctors, professional historians, and all of them have devoted decades of their lives, spending huge amounts of their own time and money, because they perceive the issue to be extraordinarily important as to what happened not only in the JFK assassination case, but in other assassinations such as the RFK and Martin Luther King cases. The official version of what happened in all of those cases is a very great departure from established facts.

**Jim Hosar** I want to go back, briefly to the Morley Case for a minute. First of all, you have to understand the way the assassination research really has worked is that, as a result of the JFK Act in particular, because of the immense deluge of documents that was released, it has taken a long time to compile and assimilate the information to piece together the parts of the puzzle. As a result of that, relatively quickly, very soon after the review board went out of existence in September of 1998. A stunningly successful conference that was held by Dr. Sherryl Welck at the Welck institute, at DuCane University. In subsequent years my organization, the Assassination Archives and Research Center, held additional conferences. Dr. Welck held additional conferences including one in 2013 again at DuCane and in 2014 the AARC held a conference on the 50th anniversary of the Warren Report out in Bethesda Maryland. We lost a great deal of money putting on that conference, but it was, I think, extraordinarily successful, we elected to provide over 41 hours of lectures given by scholars and researchers on different subjects and we decided to make those available to the public free of charge. You can go on our website and watch. You can watch on our website, the 41 hours of lectures. There were, again, extraordinary disclosures that were made during the course of those lectures.

**Jim Hosar** Antonio Bassania came and testified. He testified that ... If you're familiar with Bassania at all, it has been a huge controversy through the years as to whether or not he had identified David Phillips as a person in the presence of Lee Harvey Oswald. Antonio Bassania declared that indeed, he knew that he saw Bassania and Oswald together and that he had worked very closely with David Phillips and that while he believed that the United States had enemies, and he was passionately against Fidel Castro, he felt that a line had been crossed when the CIA murdered the President of the United States. He was quite unequivocal of it and he says, "I am an authority on conspiracies. I am a conspiracist, I know what I am talking about."

**Jim Hosar** So if you go on our website which is aarclibrary.org you can hear that. You can also hear the lectures by Professor G. Robert Blakey and Dan Hardway and Eddie Lopez, all of whom were involved in the House Elect Committee investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy. They provided a very revealing portrait of how the investigation into the House Elect Committee's inquiry was undermined by both the CIA and the FBI, severely, from its purpose of trying to get at the facts concerning those events.

**Jim Hosar** The result of these various conferences over the years, as I say, has provided stunning disclosure after stunning disclosure, and it has resulted in the publication of books by very well respected authors, for example one of the revelations that came from the reviewable disclosure was Operation North Woods, which was an attempt to use, what today we would call a terrorist act, its a false flag operations by Americans against Cuba in an effort to provoke Castro into military action and get rid of him having proceeded with that kind of operation. There have been a series of these disclosures over the years and ... So it takes time to digest, and it takes time to put things together, but the purpose of my organization is simply to gather the information and to make it available to the public, so the public can determine what the case is. This is precisely what Congress unanimously found when it did pass the JFK Act. One of the several strong reasons for immediate full disclosure ... One of them is simply the fact the congress made a promise to the American people that is was going to disclose all of this information promptly and instead we have had a series of delay, after delay, after delay.

**Jim Hosar** The additional thing ... Oh I meant to get back to ... As a consequence of researchers beginning to explore what was made available by the review board, one of the most important consequences was that Morley's law suit which requested all of the records on George E. Oniss and the CIA initially claimed that they had provided everything, it refused to confirm or deny whether it had operational records related to George Oniss.

**Jim Hosar** So that took several years of litigation, but ultimately we established that there are operational records on George Oniss, and we got a few of them released that were very significant including a photograph of George Oniss and a career citation and some travel records. What we did not get is, the CIA withheld in its entirety 295 pages of operational records. That ultimately was sustained by the court, but those records, are records that need to be released as a result of the current review, or need to be released under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to get that, a new one, because the circumstances have changed now and are on better grounds for going after those records than existed before.

**Jim Hosar** Another lawsuit that is important for you to understand is the lawsuit brought by Carl Oglesby in 1987, Carl Oglesby, you may remember, I hope, was the leader of the Vietnam war effort, he was a president of the students for democratic society. Early on, he wrote an article in 1989 or so called "The Secret Treaty of Fort Hunt", and in that he laid out the case that in a series of meetings at the end of World War II and thereafter, top American officials made a deal with General Reinhart Gehlen and the Gehlen organization to put Gehlen in charge of intelligence in Eastern Europe, in fact in all of Europe it turned out. Until such time that Germany regained its independence as a state, and then he would become head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst the equivalent of our CIA. The result of that, we have learned, as a result of the lawsuit which is now in its 28th or 29th year, was that we found after almost three decades of litigation when the CIA, which had been supposed to release all the records related to Oglesby's request including ... The CIA said that they had been forced to release as a result of the anti war crime disclosure act, anti-Nazi war crimes disclosure act.

**MC** [inaudible 01:02:12]

**Jim Hosar** Okay one, one minute.

**Jim Hosar** So, the key finding is that we found out in 2013 that, because we forced out another 113,000 pages of documents. One of them was on OSS report, which reported that Wernher von Alowtizlader Jr. according to the OSS report, was a former Nazi assassin, but in 1933 he headed, on behalf of Hitler, an off string official had then been traded back to Germany, allegedly became a known agent at that point, and went to work for the OSS. It turns out that immediately after, near the time of JFK assassination in Dallas, Wernher von Alowtizlader Jr. was in Dallas, it further turns out that he was a long time close buddy of D. Harold Byrd, the owner of the Texas School Book Depository Building. Byrd was allegedly not in Dallas at the time of the assassination, allegedly he was on a hunting safari in Mozambique. The owner of the safari [inaudible 01:03:57] the hunting expedition ... Enormous, enormously powerful expedition site in Mozambique was Wernher von Alowtizlader Jr.

**Jim Hosar** The story is much more complicated, we have put these facts before the court, in our case, and asked the court to investigate. Again information on this can be found on our website: aarclibrary.org, particularly with the case of October with some essays that have been written by Ed Daniel Alcorn who was done some really splendid research investigating this lead. I regard this as the best lead that we have ever had on the Kennedy assassination as to who may have been involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.

**Jim Hosar** Thank you very much.

**MC** Thank you Larry, Thank you Jim. Folks we're going to move in to our final panel to wrap things up, and with more detail, Andrew Craig. Andrew, please come on up.

**MC** Andrew, the gentleman who organized this entire event, and I give my earnest gratitude to him. Andrew is a member of the Capital Board of Directors. Nate Jones, director of the Freedom of Information Act project, associate of the George Washington University and actively involved in these kinds on matters and dealing with secrecy.

**MC** Adam Marshall attorney, Knight Foundation litigation attorney and active with reporters ... Freedom for the press, by the press.

**MC** Randy Benson, Randolph Benson, award winning producer, he's made a marvelous movie called "The Searchers" dealing with these matters, and Randy who is actively involved in teaching, documentary studies at Duke University, will give you the background of a wonderful, wonderful documentary.

**MC** Okay. So well start off then with Andrew. Please.

**MC** Are you guys going to speak separately, or are you going to split it up?

**Andrew Craig** Separately. [crosstalk 01:06:29]

**Andrew Craig** Okay. I'm going to get us back on time. We're pretty close to being on time. All I'm going to say is, people have heard a lot of names from history and to some extent, even though this is a very knowledgeable audience, for those watching it on film, some of these names may be, and undoubtedly are, obscure. The name Byrd who owned the Texas Book Depository, which by the way was not a public company. It was a private company owned by Byrd who was a defense contractor, so a lot of these names have different implications, and I won't try to scratch them because I'm going to give myself the one millionth sign here, right now, but I'm going to say that you heard earlier from Larry, the name Ted Cruz and Donald Trump in terms of recent happenings, and a reference that I won't repeat, to the recent election campaign. The other implications of these recent names including President Obama's past that are quite relevant to assessing his place in history.

**Andrew Craig** The name Carl Oglesby is very significant to President Obama, which I'll get into some other time perhaps. Also there are implications in all of this for every president including President Trump, because if there is a hidden mechanism for taking out presidents either by assassination, by trumped up investigations, if you can have a cover up you can have a trumped up investigation to take out our president.

**Andrew Craig** So these are issues that are still with us, and I just encourage everyone to think, this is not just history, this is potentially part of our future. Having said that, this is a different segment we have here, because this is sunshine week and it's a chance for the news organization, the news industry, to applaud open governments and getting information. So intentionally, are two speakers on this panel, who are not going to be talking about JFK so much as just generalized search for records, how to do it, two very expert individuals who can provide a practical how-to, but also the state of difficulty of the current environment. Then filmmaker Randy Benson will finish up, bringing us back to the JFK world.

**Andrew Craig** So Nate could you just [crosstalk 01:09:38]

**Nate Jones** Thanks a lot, thanks for putting this on. It's great to be here today, my name is Nate Jones from the National Security Archive and despite the official sounding name, the National Security Archive is a non-profit that files thousands of FOIA and mandatory declassification review requests each year, and we fight to get previously classified information declassified and published.

**Nate Jones** That said, I am not an expert on JFK assassination, the main reason is because the field is already crowded with experts, you here. So generally the National Security Archive focuses other matters, but I'm happy to talk today about perhaps fighting for access to records, not least of which because the JFK records collection act was one of, if not the strongest, laws ever passed for disclosing records.

**Nate Jones** I have a few points that I'll go through and hit, and anything else we can talk about it in questions.

**Nate Jones** So, what is needed today, or what we talked about earlier today, the JFK records collection act, is very important. The head of the government office of information service, which is in charge of bureaucrat in charge of collecting classifications government-wide. It's said on the record that government classifiers joked that they could classify a ham sandwich. The National Security Archive finally won a lawsuit for official CIA volume of Bay of Pigs history that the agency with the department justice lawyers argued to a judge and won, that its release could quote confuse the public, so it could remain secret. In this case we went to congress and congress actually passed the FOIA improvement act that, it is typically said that documents over 25 years can't use this pre-decisional exception any more, so we won! But the executive branch didn't do it for us, just like the JFK Act, we had to go to congress, and congress had to actually pass a law, something that is rare, but these two anti-secrecy matters happened.

**Nate Jones** Moving on, I think that the next step for these JFK records that we talked about earlier is to let the congressional foresight, that they included in passing a law play out. Here is my understanding of the state of play of these records and Jack Morley knows as well, I wish he was still here, we could talk, but according my my conversations with the national archives and ... For the record, when the national declassification center said which record should we prioritize, the number one vote was for the JFK assassination documents, and even though that's not my field I said, yes, do it. It's a wealth of information, think of the PR boost, and it's the most popular, show your clout by declassifying these. I also said that Obama need not wait until October 2017 to release these remaining records. In both cases they didn't listen to me. So the state of play, so far as I know is that ... I actually have it, you can pass this around, here.

**Nate Jones** There are currently, according to the national archives, 3,603 records withheld in full and another 41,000 records, not pages, records, that are withheld apart. My friend Microninsky wisely did a FOIA request to NARA for an index of the 3001 records. Here are just some of them, you can pass them around, and you can see the names of what I think, I predict, will be coming out within months. The Nasenco transcript, talked about earlier are in them.

**Nate Jones** Essentially what has to happen for these records and more to come out. The answer is nothing. As far as I understand the national archives is working right now to release all of the records as demanded by law, unless an agency petitions the President, and the President says do not. My conversations with NARA, and they have given some public statements, say that they are working hard to declassify ... As of months ago they had it during the Obama administration, they hadn't heard ... I asked well when are you going to hear? How are you going to hear? They didn't really know, but they said they probably would come through agency petitions to the national security counsel and that ultimately it would be up to the president to tell NARA not to release. What's going to happen? I don't know, we've already speculated a little bit we can keep doing that, that's fun, but the issue is that the ball is in the President's court. Congress, I think, did its good job and the defacto is they're going to provide, unless the President stops release.

**Nate Jones** I would just end with one more point and we can talk more questions, I'm sure everybody has good stuff, that the importance of the anti-secrecy strong congressional mandate of the JFK Records Act and Jim mentioned the Nazi War Crimes Act also. It still resonates and we need more of that with other documents. Here is the National Declassification Center's recent report, citing the JFK Collection Records Act in 1992, stating quote: "that this legislative critic criteria for exemption is much more stringent, than that would be later required by an executive order on classification." So today, the situation is that information that is currently technically properly classified, including those ham sandwiches that I opened with, and the fact that the Cuban missile crisis ended by taking the Jupiter missiles out of Italy, is a proper secret, is that the requirements to be classified, are far too low. Congress did the right thing with the JFK Act by saying they need to pass the credibility test or ... that's what I call, is much higher leader standards.

**Nate Jones** My final point is that this sunshine week, you should look back and celebrate the JFK Records Review Act. Optimistically, and I hope realistically, expect that the vast bulk of the future records will be released in October 2016, that's my prediction, and celebrate the success and begin working on how we can get congress to mandate that more records, beyond this very important universe, are also released congressionally.

**Adam Marshall** Good afternoon, my name is Adam Marshall, I'm an attorney at the Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the Press. Among other things, I participate in federal FOIA litigation and state public records litigation. That's about all I do. For those of you that are unaware that the Reporter's Committee is a non-profit based here, in Washington D.C., we primarily assist reporters and news organizations and all kinds of legal issues regarding the collection and dissemination of the news. My part in our organization's responsibilities is, like I said, is getting reported information from the government.

**Adam Marshall** So I thought what I would tell you about, a little bit, because it is sunshine week, is the state of FOIA, which I'm sure you all already know, and also to talk a little bit about the recent amendments to FOIA that were brought in the 2016 updates. Then, finally to look forward a little bit in terms of what needs to be fixed with FOIA, so that we can get access to even more records.

**Adam Marshall** The state of FOIA, for all of you who use it, as I said before, you know is really terrible, the previous administration set records for denying access to more records than ever before. The 2016 numbers from the department of justice came out, and it's clear that nothing is really improving. The government set a new record, I believe this year, for responding that they could not find records responsive to requests. And this is coming from an administration that had a pretty avowed commitment to opening this, and still this is what we got.

**Adam Marshall** Jeff Sessions who is the new attorney general, not a fan of FOIA, he acted to hold up the 2016 amendments, he has not issued a memo yet on FOIA, as previous attorneys generals have. There may be a couple reasons for that, one is that there are just other things going on, and the other is that ... Part of what the 2016 amendments did is codify a back and forth that had gone on between Democratic and Republican administrations of the past, in terms of what types of lawsuits they would defend. I'll get to that in a second. One of the other interesting pieces of information that came out just recently from the Department of Justice is that last year, the Obama administration spent 36,000,000 million dollars defending FOIA lawsuits. Which is just an incredible amount of money. You can imagine that if they spent a little bit of that perhaps, towards records management or towards getting more FOIA officers, the public might be better served. Instead we have 36,000,000 million dollars defending against the public's right of access.

**Adam Marshall** So, we've already talked a little bit, and they talked a little bit, about the 2016 amendments to FOIA, the work that they've done to increase access to historical records, specifically records older than 25 years old. The FOIA amendments did a lot of other interesting things. One is that they codified the foreseeable harm standard. From now on, under FOIA, it's not enough that a record merely technically fall within the scope of an exemption. The government in this has also described how release of the record would cause harm, they reasonable foresee the release of the record would cause harm, identified by the exception.

**Adam Marshall** So a record is classified, or a law enforcement record, it's not just enough that, yes, it technically meets the scope of the exemption that is outlined in the case law today. The government now, has to take an additional step of explaining why disclosure would result in harm. There are other nice amendments with respect to administrative appeals, you now have a longer time to do that. OGIS was also strengthened for those who don't want to go to court always, because it's expensive and time consuming. OGIS now has some more independence. OGIS is the Office of Governmental Information Services, it's located within the National Archives. And they can be a really great, I think, resource for people, who just want some basic help and are getting stonewalled by agencies.

**Adam Marshall** Those improvements are nice, but there is, I think, still more work to be done. I think it's pretty clear ... We've seen that the executive branch is not interested in voluntarily increasing transparency, that they have to be dragged kicking and screaming by the legislative branch and that usually happens about once every ten years. We have in 2016 there were amendments in 2008 there were amendments, before that, in '97 or '98 there were amendments, then '86 before that. I think it would be great if we had more frequent amendments to FOIA than once a decade, because there are so many important things out there. I think in particular, we need to seriously consider reform of the law enforcement exemption. That's exemption seven. Exemption seven has gotten to such a place now, that if there is anything remotely touching on a law enforcement activity, the government pretty much routinely with holds it as a matter of course. The courts have adopted a pretty expansive interpretation of that exemption.

**Adam Marshall** It's really frustrating, any attempts to get access to anything by DOJ or other law enforcement agencies. It's made so that, I think, also there's a lot of room to reform classification, and the way that it interacts with exemption one.

**Adam Marshall** It's unclear to what extent to foreseeable harm standard is going to interact with classification and exemption one. My guess is that it probably won't have a whole lot of impact, because judges are pretty differential when it comes to agency assertions, that information will be damaging if it's released already, but you never know. I think there's room for development in the case law there. 50 years on, I think that FOIA remains a really important tool, one of the primary tools that reporters use for getting information from the government. I love it, I think that it's a messy field, but not something that we should shy away from.

**Adam Marshall** I'm happy to take any questions, as long as you need, about the specifics of FOIA, the nuts and bolts and we can get into that.

**Whole Audience** I have a question.

**Adam Marshall** Yes.

**MC** Why don't we finish off with Randy and then open it up to the panel? To the four of them. Is that okay?

**Adam Marshall** Yeah, sure.

**MC** Randy.

**Randolph Benson** Okay, Thanks.

**MC** Randy, and then we'll open it up to the four for discussion, okay?

**MC** We're doing well on time. Randy, please.

**Randolph Benson** Hi, I'm Randy Benson, and I'm a filmmaker, and an instructor at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. I've made a film called "The Searchers", it's a portrait of JFK assassination researchers. My original intent in making the film was that it would be a well researched, two year process, where I would make a film and finish it, and move on to other things.

**Randolph Benson** But as everyone in this room knows, once you choose to go down this path, you find yourself later in life still doing the same thing, still asking questions. I shot the first frame of this film on June 10th, 2002, right here in D.C. with John Judges' commemoration at the JFK's peace speech at American University, and that got me on the path. Fourteen years later, the film is finished, we've been accepted to two festivals, Tiburon Film Festival in San Francisco next month, and the Orlando Film Festival, and that's in May. It's also screening at the DPUK Conference in Canterbury, England next month. So if you can make it to Canterbury, please do.

**Randolph Benson** If you'd like to learn more, by the way, just visit the website: thesearchersfilm.com. Cirrol White here is featured in the film. Today I spent with Cirrol and his office was a lot of fun. I like to tell this story. He is the busiest human being I've ever met and you'd have to put sicko-fan into my vocabulary. Thank you very much. But he gave us all the time we needed answered all the questions and it was a great discussion, and we were sitting there after as we were wrapping and then, I don't know if he'll remember, but I said, "You know, I'd love to take you out to lunch, show my appreciation for your time," and he said "well, I'm sorry gentlemen, I would love to take you around and show you my beautiful city, but I have to be in court in 20 minutes." Of course, we were like, "we didn't know, I'm so sorry. Go, go go!" The experience of openness and welcoming of a seeming outsider to a research community, wasn't necessarily unique to Cirrol. Everybody was welcoming and willing to talk about the film and the case, and their experiences in the case.

**Randolph Benson** In regards to the themes of this conference, a lot of my film uses, of course, archival footage, news footage, and also films in the plaza, a lot of contemporary news footage, of course from the Today Show, and one of my early problems was getting access to footage. For instance I wanted to use a ten second segment from the Today Show, and I'd heard about this interaction between Katie Couric and Joe Bosner, and I just needed ten seconds. Well it cost 30 dollars for transcripts, printed transcripts, and that was fine, and then they said to use it, after I had sent my application in and vetted my film, my prospectus, my treatment, they wanted 300 dollars a second and I couldn't just buy the ten second segment, I had to buy the entire segment. The five and a half minute image.

**Randolph Benson** By doing that, organizations and institutions are making it impossible, and that was the whole point. It was very clear that that's the point.

**Whole Audience** Who was going to charge you that much?

**Randolph Benson** NBC.

**Whole Audience** They're crooks.

**Randolph Benson** Oh yeah, yeah. But it was the Today Show ... I started teaching at the Center for Documentary Studies in 2003 and we partner with the Duke University School of Law and about ten years ago they opened their Center for the Study of the Public Domain which does ground breaking work in helping independent documentary film makers acquire and use footage in their films. Here in The Center for Social Media at The School of Communications here at America University does amazing work, as does the Washington College of Law here at AU. Also the Stanford University School of Law [inaudible 01:29:45] youth center. All these organizations are partnering and working together to make sure that artists and filmmakers can create work using footage that has to be used to illustrate the point. To further dialogue.

**Randolph Benson** In the last number of years the use of the Zapruder film has been extremely difficult for independent filmmakers. The sixth floor has traditionally sent many legal letters out, threatening filmmakers with lawsuits and most of us just simply can't afford that. But the Duke's Center for Study of Pubic Domain, and especially the Stanford College of Law department, has done amazing work and is now willing to take many many cases, pro bono, to help independent filmmakers and artists with many of these issues. When I had a conversation with a Dean at the Duke Law School, he said, "Oh please let them ... Send me a letter, you should beg them to send you a letter, because they want this law suit, we want ..." And they were begging me to do it. You need to talk to my wife man.

**Randolph Benson** Anyway, it's an exciting time for the use of archival footage in non-fiction films and so, if anyone has any questions. [crosstalk 01:31:51] Any one please forward them to me.

**MC** Andrew has a few more comments. Randy sit up here please.

**Randolph Benson** [inaudible 01:31:59]

**MC** We're going to open it up. I want to acknowledge the presence of three of our other Cabinet Board members. Alphabetically Bill Kelly, Mike Nartaud, and Jerry Folickhoff. Gentlemen stand up, let the people see [inaudible 01:32:17].

**MC** Okay, Andrew.

**Andrew Craig** Okay, I just wanted to say, we'll get to Larry in a moment, that was a great presentation, that everyone has been so concise that we have extra time for questions, but also a little extra overview as to some of these extra institutions that we may have rushed through the introduction. I think that one thing people have seen, both from Judge Trunhimm and the other FOIA experts is that this is complicated stuff. So it's not just sending out a letter, it's dealing with all of the objections in a knowledgeable way. Institutions and organizations like some of those who are represented around the room, but most precisely by the Reporter's Committee for Freedom of Press and the National Security Archive who do this, it's important that there be knowledgeable people like this. And, of course, Jim and AARC and others are on camera, it's new but . . . So it's complicated stuff.

**Andrew Craig** Again, as Judge Trunhimm said sometimes they don't know what's going to be relevant and important. How many people know who Odenedes was? I think we kind of scooted though at times introduction to George Odenedes. He passed away some years ago. He was the person that the CIA named to help the last official investigation of this by the House in the mid-1970s. They said "oh he will help you find out all the documents with the CIA that relate to this." What they never said was that he was a major player with the Cuban exile community and he was one of the most important people involved arguably in the organization. It did not come out until all of this FOIA stuff. The people realized, wait a second the guy who was saying to the House of Representatives "oh you don't need to watch, look at that." That could involved his own operation.

**Andrew Craig** The last thing I wanted to say as kind of an overview was that Adam's group Reporters Committee for the Freedom of Press was the co-founder of sunshine week with the American Society of Newspaper Editors and a number of [inaudible 01:35:10] We are especially glad to have you here at sunshine week and I will just say parenthetically that Adam spoke at another event at the National Archives for the program in front of Ralph Nader on Monday and one of the things that Ralph Nader said was that his hometown requires all students to file Freedom of Information actions as part of their education to teach that democracy is much more than voting every four years or whatever. It's continual involvement and I think what he said was once they get into it [inaudible 01:36:00] So they try to give them an easy one . . . They get very involved and very civic minded in a lot more ways.

**Andrew Craig** Before going to Larry, well Larry you had a point?

**LarryAraschnapp** I had a question for

**MC** We're going to go into questions now

**Andrew Craig** Okay. I have a first question for Randy. What a fascinating story for NBC and of course NBC was one of the chief coverup parties in this whole investigation which I'm sure is the background of giving you a hard time. Here's my question . . . They are passively using clips from other networks. CNN might use a Fox clip. Why is your situation different? How can they use these clips on rival networks and then give you difficulty?

**Randolph Benson** That's a great question. I don't necessarily have the answer for that other than that the major news organizations do work together. They share clips. [crosstalk 01:37:16]

**Jerry Folickhof** I had sued some [inaudible 01:37:38] son in a law suit that was brought on behalf of Chip Selby who at the time was a graduate in film school at the University of Maryland. He produced a film called Reasonable Doubt at the medical and scientific evidence.

**Andrew Craig** When was this?

**Jerry Folickhof** This would have been 1980s, around 1989 or 1992 I believe it was in conjunction about the time of the Oliver Stone film. My memory's a little hazy on it but it may have been the 1980s. We sued on the ground that the recruiter had no copyright because the copyright protection was overruled by the First Amendment and this guy was small attention in the New York Times which reported on the filing of the suit and said that this was a very unusual position to take. The history of it, it actually goes back to the Josiah Thomson's book in 1967 when he produced Six Seconds in Dallas and he used charcoal engravings that he purloined from Life magazine and he was sued by Time Life for copyright infringement and the district court judge ruled that it constituted fair use but the review board ultimately expropriated this recruiter thing. They didn't take the copyright but the Texas Schoolbook Suppository claimed it and they are claiming it to this day they're extorting great sums of money to try to get at the reason why NBC is trying to charge you is because they have to pay the Texas Schoolbook Suppository.

**Jerry Folickhof** I would imagine that is the case. It has been very, very slipshod in the enforcement of it. Sometimes they get away with it and sometimes they don't. Just basically, no one that can [inaudible 01:40:30] is afford the time and the effort to stand up to their claim. They even have gone so far as, when I was there for . . . They had asserted a copyright claim on the 6th floor window from which Oswald allegedly fired the shot.

**Andrew Craig** You know you are featured in Alexandra Zuprider's book?

**Jerry Folickhof** Yeah, very strangely she doesn't mention the fact that I had sued her father for copyright infringement. She doesn't mention, she is a copyright lawyer herself, but she does not mention Nemer and the First Amendment issue. Nemer who was the leading pre-eminent authority on copyright at the time of the lawsuit and for many years after, when he died. Nemer had given two examples which he said the first amendment right to public information would override the copyright provision. Whiteland was the famous photograph of the 4 year old Meli girl who had been torched by napalm running down the street. [crosstalk 01:41:59] The second was a group

**MC** Yeah, Larry go ahead

**LarryAraschnapp** So this may be an inside baseball law question which you guys may be able to answer

**MC** Speak up so

**LarryAraschnapp** So did that bring to that the judges gave to the agency, is that based on Chevron doctrine?

**Adam Marshall** No

**LarryAraschnapp** No, I know that Congress is contemplating getting rid of the Chevron doctrine.

**Adam Marshall** At least in the DC circuit, there is no Chevron difference given to agencies. The difference is given, it depends upon the exemption. The difference is usually either derived from the legislative history of the FOIA exemptions in which Congress had . . . We are creating this exemption but judges when you look at this you should pay attention to agency affidavits. In other exemptions, I think courts have created difference based on their perception that the agency is in a better position to understand the nature of the materials and the potential effect of their release . . . The courts will say I'm not an expert in national security, I'm not an expert in specific law enforcement areas so I'm going to differ to the rationale here. It's not based on [crosstalk 01:43:37]

**LarryAraschnapp** Any legislative effort would not effect that ability?

**Adam Marshall** No

**Nate Jones** In answer to the NBC situation, I do

**MC** Speak up Nate

**Nate Jones** I do licensing with NBC and they have agreements . . . I know that Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC, I assume CNN probably also does and sometime you have the same ownership . . . They have agreements with each other. They can be choosey, not for regular films or with television programs, but for news broadcasts, they can use any of them that they want. [crosstalk 01:44:22]

**Jerry Folickhof** If you want to give me the time, what really brought about the showing of this recruiter film on NBC and it is a fascinating story and very few people know it.

**MC** When you say if you have the time

**Jerry Folickhof** Two minutes

**MC** Go ahead Jerry

**Jerry Folickhof** I met Robert Grodman in 1967 and he worked in Manhattan. I worked and lived in New York and Harold Weisport got us together. I was the first person he ever showed this film to. For years I was trying to get him to go public with it and he would tell me no, they'll kill me and I said they'll kill you if you don't go public.

**Whole Audience** Jerry excuse me how did he get it to begin with?

**Jerry Folickhof** He worked for an outfit that Life magazine brought the film to because they didn't have the equipment that they needed to duplicate it. They also didn't have the expertise to know that the guy that ran that company made a copy. Robert later went to work them and that is where it all began. He finally aired it at the AIB in Cambridge. He showed the film there, it was actually the second time he showed it. He showed it the year before at Bud festival's conference in, where's that

**Speaker 11** Georgetown in 1973

**Jerry Folickhof** But this time was a little different because Dick Gregory was in the audience and Dick Gregory went absolutely bonkers and we spent the rest of the night in Dick Gregory's hotel room working on Robert to agree to just go on the road and show the film. Don't go home, don't change, I'll buy you a wardrobe and one of Dick Gregory's good friends was Geraldo Rivera. So he called Geraldo Rivera and Rivera was all excited about it and he said okay I'll show the film. Well then the ABC lawyers got involved and they said no no no you can't do that, it's copyrighted. He said look the only reason you are going to keep me, and I know this because Geraldo told me the backstory and I was there the night it was shown on Goodnight America. They basically told him no you can't do it and he said the only way you are going to keep me from doing it is by firing me and then I'll go on the road with it.

**Jerry Folickhof** The night of the show he goes there and they hand him a piece of paper and they told him that this document basically, you are excepting full responsibility if Life sues us, its basically your problem, you owe them the money. Of course, he changed his mind and he said I was a stupid broke, young reporter, I didn't have any money, so I signed it. I'm sure it was not really behind the scenes of privatement for ABC, they could not stop him. Actually, we not only owe Robert Groddin and Dick Gregory kudos for later, but Geraldo Rivera. I am not a big fan of his[crosstalk 01:48:03] I know but if not for Geraldo, they did everything they could to stop him from doing it.

**MC** Larry tell us your story about Geraldo in the park with you

**LarryAraschnapp** This is actually about a year ago. I'm with my new dog and I'm walking up . . . I live on 87th and Park and Madison. I'm with my dog and we go up to 89th Street and we turn and there is Geraldo with these two little peepee dogs. Geraldo being how macho as he was it was really funny seeing these little tiny dogs. So I see him and I walk up to him and say hey you know I loved your work when you released the recruiter film. He goes Arrggh. I said what to do you mean arrggh. I said you know we are going to be doing a mock trial and we are going to be building on what you did. He goes oh that's all bullshit and he starts going on about how the Warren Commission was right. So he's completely done 180 degrees on it and he actually walked away from me. I wish my dog would have pissed on him at that point. [crosstalk 01:49:19]

**MC** Andrew

**Andrew Craig** A small quick point. We heard how Life magazine bought the exclusive rights to the Zapruder film and also, by the way, they bought the exclusive rights of Marina Oswald's memoirs which were never published. Something seems strange here and I am going to give it a quick answer. Here is a publishing outfit that doesn't publish the memoirs of Marian Oswald, doesn't publish the Zapruder film, this is a clear case of it's worth more dead than alive [crosstalk 01:49:59] . . . Two other small points in doing secondary reading about all of this stuff, I see that the publisher of Time and Life, two of the most important magazines in the 1960s, was getting Charles Douglas Jackson, who was the former National Security Advisor to President Eisenhower and the leading figure in all of America in psychological warfare and that involves slanting Hollywood movies going back to World War II. So you start thinking, and here is the last thing[crosstalk 01:50:34]

**Andrew Craig** But Jackson goes way back with Henry Luess and those guys, but you start thinking wait a second so the guy who is head of psychological warfare for the United States ends up publishing Time and Life magazine, acquiring all of this evidence and suppressing it, and the last point to fast forward, we wonder why CNN and these guys don't want to cover this story. CNN is of course the lineal descendant of Time Life. It is not just this story, it undermines the entire narrative of a worthy establishment press and not the fake news people. This is a story that could be incredibly devastating to that narrative, that there be real journalists and that includes of [crosstalk 01:51:39]

**LarryAraschnapp** They went beyond that . . . They went beyond suppressing in probably the most printable pictures against Oswald [crosstalk 01:51:48]

**Whole Audience** So the question for you, I was impressed when you had the two gentlemen sitting there representing [crosstalk 01:52:00] You proved to me, right in front of me, that there was more than one shot and that there was more than one shooter so in your professional opinion, how many shots do you think were fired and since you said they were coming from different angles, how many shooters do you think there were.

**Speaker 1** Well I think we got a count for 4 shots. It is kind of hard to tell because of some things that were removed and there was the curbstone and of course the fact that they never did the kind of investigation that should have been conducted. That's my

**Whole Audience** And shooters?

**Speaker 1** Pardon me. I don't know who the other shooter was. I have no way of knowing who it was. There are several things to remember. From the single bullet theory for me is this, there are all kinds of people on the pro Warren Commission side that would love to walk away from the single bullet theory that aren't thrilled with it and there are many people I know who speak to audience with who . . . Maybe hear something and I always say to those people this is your pregnant or your not pregnant. Without any way of minimizing the important of all the wonderful work that all of these people whom you have heard from today and all the others that we know including our beloved colleagues now gone, Mark Lane, Howard Weisberg, and then others who are not with us today are very, very important and all of it together also . . . What I am saying is if you destroy the single bullet theory scientifically then what your showing is there was a second shooter.

**Speaker 1** The point is under the laws of 50 states and federal laws two people involved in the planning, commission and coverup of a crime is a conspiracy. Right? That is their problem. That they cannot open the goddamn door. They would like to be able to wiggle out a little bit but they can't wiggle because once you open the door for conspiracy, where does it take you? There is no end to that [crosstalk 01:54:30]

**LarryAraschnapp** Interesting standpoint. Think about this for a moment, chronological basis. The FBI on December 9 comes up with their report and they conclude there were 3 separate bullets. Two bullets hit the President and one hit Connelly. They come up with a supplemental report in January, same conclusion. The initial memos in the Warren Commission say the same thing. Without any additional information, there is no other evidence that is put in the record. Suddenly, there is a magic bullet. You have all these conclusions that are built on evidentiary basis, and suddenly with the evidence, there is a different interpretation.

**Andrew Craig** It was James T. who came forward

**LarryAraschnapp** But they always knew about that bullet [crosstalk 01:55:19] . . The point is in a courtroom, right, that record, they knew about that missing bullet.

**Whole Audience** Why did the posture change to a bullet missed?

**Andrew Craig** Because of James T.

**LarryAraschnapp** In the record they ignored the missed bullet. The FBI ignored the missed bullet but it was in the record.

**Speaker 1** They actually stalled on investigating it. It took them something like 9 months where they actually had gotten down to Dallas. [crosstalk 01:56:03] They patched the curbstone.

**LarryAraschnapp** In May or June or something

**Andrew Craig** One of the problems was if that bullet had been fired from the 6th floor it might have missed the limousine by about 100 feet.

**LarryAraschnapp** Well the point is that you were in a court of law, this would have already been established and suddenly they just changed their whole opinion.

**Jim Hosar** I was in a court of law, I actually took the deposition of the FBI agents that conducted the examination of the curbstone. I subpoenaed the curbstone to my office along with the magic bullet. I asked Robert Frasier who was the FBI's firearms expert to feel the curbstone and advise whether or not it had been patched. He refused to testify on the grounds that he was an expert witness and had to be made an expert witness

**LarryAraschnapp** They still have no evidence that they can introduce to change the original expert opinions [crosstalk 01:57:21]

**Whole Audience** For your trial, the mock trial, we had two real trials. There was of course Jim Garrison's trial, but Mark Lenny with the liable trial in Miami, 1985, the story is a little bit plausible and denial, you have the testimony of Marie DeLorenz saying not only was she part of a caravan of two vehicles filled with Cuban exiles and guns going to Dallas, but the [inaudible 01:57:48] was headmaster, he was handing out money to Dallas and afterwards Sturgis, you know he fled because he was terrified of what was going on, that she missed her chance to be [crosstalk 01:58:00]

**LarryAraschnapp** We are trying Lee Harvey Oswald on the criminal case

**Whole Audience** So this is exculpatory

**LarryAraschnapp** Its potentially exculpatory, right. That is secondary to what we are trying to establish.

**Whole Audience** Sure

**Jerry Folickhof** Now the New York Times proved you were wrong, surely. In 1967 when the case was bubbling over and nobody could read the Warren report and it was going up in flames, they had an article in the magazine [inaudible 01:58:25] case it was by Henry Fairly and it was entitled "Conspiracy Known Two Assassins Perhaps". They decided it was too low cut.

**LarryAraschnapp** Independently

**Speaker 1** They always like to view things to common sense, especially when you talking to an audience like this where people are knowledgeable obviously about the case. Just stand back for a moment and you're Oswald . . . Let' stick to Oswald because that's the government's ploy . . . Now remember, you have the car turning off onto Houston and then onto Falcon. As that car is coming up that one block on Houston, you are there and you're Oswald, the car is coming right at you every millisecond it is a foot or two closer, right there. You wait until the car turns and is going away from you downhill, some foliage sporadically blocks your view, and you're not Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or whoever those people were who could shoot off the top of a finger one by one. [crosstalk 01:59:52]

**Speaker 1** If he's there and whatever the bug up his ass, I still don't know to this day, going with the Warren Commission I still don't know what Oswald's motive was [crosstalk 02:00:07] . . . He's upset, I don't know, whatever it is, he wants to kill the President. Well Goddamn it then kill the President.

**LarryAraschnapp** That would have led right back to his window. That's the excuse to why [crosstalk 02:00:31] . . . Don't you think it's fascinating that something now the right wing has discovered the deep state? All these years it denied it exists and now suddenly there's a deep state.

**Speaker 1** Well you toss around this right wing and left wing too, I don't want to get off on a political tangent here but I have been amazed and shocked over the years and I can't think of all the different names or the different individuals, by no means the left liberals are on our side. By means, I mean 100%, there is a lot of left liberals and for that matter the New York Times, they're certainly a little bit left to center.

**LarryAraschnapp** Matthews is one

**Speaker 1** Yeah. Geraldo, I was very close to Geraldo and I was on his program probably 50 times over the years and we talk . . . [crosstalk 02:01:25] I just want to say this is not such a clear cut thing. You would think that the liberals would but we recently know . . . Chonsky of course he's a goddamn left wing liberal lunatic and the most vicious anti-Semitic . . . one time, some time Jew in the world. That is what I call his people, a one time some time Jew anti-Semitic . . .

**Speaker 1** Any other, yes

**Whole Audience** Right so what can we do with Judge Trunhimm perhaps the archives specialist, I'm sorry I forgot your name,

**Adam Marshall** Adam Marshall and Nate Jones

**Whole Audience** Adam. Approaching this deadline, what are some of the things that you having not being in the senior, you are kind of looking at it from the outside, what should be happening to . . . Someone had mentioned an independent approaching as these files are going to be organized and potentially released

**Adam Marshall** We are here today because we want you guys to write about this. The media has to get this story, they are ignoring it.

**Whole Audience** Right, but what I am saying is we have a specialist, so what would he see what we can do? The press would be great, but as we approach this, there is a special mechanism there, is the archives, we don't want to push their buttons and get in their face about it. What could we do to guarantee to increase the odds of successful [crosstalk 02:03:11]

**Adam Marshall** I think that it is unlikely that the FBI and CIA are going to forget to argue to the National Security Council that they should not release anything. I think they are going to make that case. [inaudible 02:03:23] . . . I don't think so. That said, the best case would make it politically infeasible for the President to block the release of documents.

**Whole Audience** So is like a monthly meeting that they would have? Is it on a calendar, we can see something?

**Adam Marshall** [crosstalk 02:03:41] The only limited information I know is that the regulations aren't really written too clearly but the National Archives has indicated that it would be agencies questioning the National Security Council on a document by document basis. I would raise it to the highest levels.

**Whole Audience** Is it a rolling release?

**Adam Marshall** No. One is on the 25th anniversary on October

**Whole Audience** During the . . . They are in the process right now of declassification? Presumably they are notifying the agency internally?

**Adam Marshall** Yeah. The quote is from the NARA official Thomas Murphy no agency has formerly requested a waiver yet. Yet some have gotten back for clarification and we are seeing more in predication and she also said that she expected that someone asked for waivers but there is no information on it.

**Whole Audience** Is the President sort of an acupuncture point? Can he preemptively say we are releasing these documents?

**Jim Hosar** Can you let me answer that? The answer is that if Trump wants to use it, he has a very civil mechanism for doing so. He simply issues an executive order that all documents that have been requested under mandatory declassification review or ICECAP that they be released forthwith. There is nothing that I can think of that anyone can do to stop it.

**Whole Audience** That's our acupuncture point. We need to press him on that.

**Jim Hosar** The other thing is that my response

**LarryAraschnapp** Roger still believes in this

**Jim Hosar** What you need to do to up the odds of getting a full release is report on a series of lawsuits that my organization has filed that will raise these issues and spate . . . For example, I have one, a lawsuit that I haven't filed but there was a cable dated November 22, 1963 which involves the maritime ex filtration of Anthony Sephorsa to Mexico City where he is to meet Matt Daer the following day with Chovin. Chovin being the pseudonym for David Phillips. This is going on November 22, 1963, I requested a copy of that, it was only 2 digraphs withheld in the document . . . Under the review board's, according to the official record identification form, it was to be produced to the public in 2007 I think. It hasn't been, it's still being withheld.

**MC** Somebody wants to ask a question in the audience.

**Whole Audience** My question is are there friends elsewhere who we could pressure to pressure the White House?

**Speaker 1** Well it may reach a point that . . . When this becomes highlighted, when it is placed in focus, and at this time as you have heard, there is no point of contention of expressed obstinacy as of this time. There may come a time that reaching out to friends . . . Friends would be congressman and U.S. senators and other people connected to the administration . . . What we don't know, I don't know and I've heard different things from different people, what does Donald Trump think about the . . . when he was a young guy [crosstalk 02:08:21]

**LarryAraschnapp** He has a very narrow circle of people he listens to.

**Whole Audience** Melania

**LarryAraschnapp** That's beside the point. It's Ivanka, it's Jared, it's [inaudible 02:08:31] Fanning, it's Kelly Ann Conway. If you know anyone who notices me, [crosstalk 02:08:38] . . . Roger Stone, right. These are the people that could influence him. Simply going to Congress is great, but he does not have a strong relationship with Congress.

**Speaker 1** What I want to ask Andrew is one of the people you said you had spoken to I thought was the uncle of Jared Christner? Lawland

**Andrew Craig** Exactly. Let me just before the Chairman wraps up here in a moment try to encompass some of these comments, what can people do? You should know that you have already done part of it by coming here today because you see originally there was no conference. We created this conference to maximize our impact beyond [crosstalk 02:09:27] . . . what a petition . . . you know handing in 220,000 petitions is pointless. We've had two White House correspondents here, one is still here . . . We also have had Roger Stone here and I happen to know Roger and I said well look realistically send the book out rather than him come here to Washington to be on a panel for 10 minutes, can you give us a quote for our papers . . .

**Andrew Craig** I hope you picked them up. The VIPs that we got and rather than trying to bring them all here to speak for 5 minutes a piece, we've got the National Archives saying he's working on it. We've got four former staff attorneys for the Warren Commission saying release the documents and as several mentioned is Jared Cushner's uncle, [crosstalk 02:10:32] . . . an attorney in Florida. He's right there in the documents saying release the documents. For those of you who are reporters or just interested, go to the KAPA website, find all of that stuff that is there, [inaudible 02:10:53] . . . Social media or write a story or something. This is got to be bottom up because Time Life is not going to be here. By the way they were invited. They don't want to hear this stuff so we have to rely on the alternative media which is you. With that, . . .

**Speaker 1** No speeches, everyone has talked long enough including me. I want to again thank Andrew Craig for having organized this. Thanks to my colleagues on the KAPA board who are here Larry Araschnapp and Bill Kelly and Jerry Folickhoff and Mike Durcot and myself. I want to thank all of you, many of you have stayed here now through the entire afternoon for coming. The message is, not necessarily for me to try to say anything that would be the least bit original. We will see what happens, this is the beginning as Winston Churchill said when there was great victory early on when the allies seemed to be coming back from the Hitler onslaught, this is not the beginning of the end of the war, he said it could be the beginning of the beginning, something like that. That's where we are, it's the beginning of the beginning, we'll see what unfolds here. The only comment I will make that I'm sure all of you share is that . . .

**Speaker 1** Any of these people, the New York Times, Time Life, the CIA or the FBI and there will come a time when to make these comments publicly, I hope when given the opportunity. My question is this, is 53 and a half . . . What ever it is. I speak to somebody, I have been dealing with investigations and homicide investigations for 55 years and in my professional life at all times all over including some deaths in foreign countries . . . My question is very simple as an attorney, what possibly could there be of a sensitive, potentially harmful nature, to any agency of the United States government at this time, by full disclosure of the all of the Oswald records? If you have, go with the Warren Commission, use that as your weapon. Oswald did this by himself, nobody at any time from beginning to end, had any knowledge, had any input, rendered any assistance, absolutely nothing right. He did it by himself. Therefore, and it is 54 years later, what is there possibly that there could be?

**Speaker 1** As far as with Russia and with China, well why? There is nothing at all that could possibly . . . Did they not a couple months or so ago call for the release of, approve the release of some stuff dealing with 9/11?

**Andrew Craig** Yes they did

**Speaker 1** Now there is still people that still talk about . . . And in fact there are some things that have a potentially really delicate nature insofar as . . . 18 of those 20 people as I recall were Saudis right? These are our big buddies, the Saudis. There is some potentially damaging, compromising stuff right there, yet they are releasing that and they can talk about that. What the hell is there to talk about, this punk, this nothing Oswald shoots . . . Look at the past assassins who had killed presidents before so what is the big deal? That's the way to just talk to the guy on the street and reach out and let's see what unfolds. I want to thank all of the people that talked here today at presentations. I think it has been a tremendous afternoon and I only wish that we could get this out to the world. It is my impression and I haven't seen any national poll taken recently, but it's my impression after speaking to all kinds of groups about JFK that . . . It will be two weeks tomorrow at a theater . . .

**Speaker 1** People just love to hear about this and the great majority of people, especially if you then talk to them and explain some of the facts and so on, are not buying the Warren Commission. What else can you think of that has had the official imprimatur of the United States government for a half a century that has been repeatedly emphasized and attempts continuously by all kinds of groups and agencies from the top double down to corroborate to butchers to support in every way those findings, and they have not succeeded in winning over a majority of the American public. Whether our numbers are down to 60%, there was once a high of 83%, I don't know whether its 85, 75, 65, 60, I know that is definitely more than 50%. Think about that, what does that tell you?

**Speaker 1** What else can you think of that matches that, that the government has failed to get across. Andrew, or somebody mentioned how they were referred to had the conspiratorial or conspiratorial lunatics, conspiratorial buffs and so on, turn that around. We are the goddamn majority. We are the majority, don't let them make us into a minority. We are the majority. I have lived my entire life of 86 years as a member of a minority as a Jew and know I'm going to be the member of a majority goddamn it.
