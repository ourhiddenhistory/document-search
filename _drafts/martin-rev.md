**Interviewer 1** I'm just going to ask you a few questions, and then you guys, there might be some questions you'd like to ask also, because we're all on the same team in here. I know that you did the first Suicide album in four days which is mind blowing to me.

**Martin Rev** We did it in half an hour. Kind of like we had a live show. We cut it together, and it took 30 minutes to make the record is what it took, and then it was bowled over by the producers one at a time. He was painfully honest. He let... Marty had never produced a record before, and they asked us. They said, what do you think about it? I said sure, go ahead. What a foul. He went over it track, by track, by track. So we changed a couple of things, like these lyrics, and we decided to change the 'Frankie Teardrop' and I added a couple of little dots here and there hardly anything, I can assure you but that's all it took. So four days is... No, we did it. It took about more like four weeks for them to finally release it.

**Interviewer 1** Yeah, I knew that Craig had worked with reggae artists, a lot of dub artists, and they were sort of going through [inaudible 00:01:25]. Did you choose him because of that, or did he?

**Martin Rev** Marty found... chose him. I never knew who Craig Leon was actually at all. Anytime I went to [inaudible 00:01:37] he was here, even though he had done quite a lot of work already in many fields, and Marty came in one day, because Marty had asked us if he could manage us around March of that year. He tried to sell us to labels and get us... I had auditioned for Mercury Records, and all of a sudden a few months later, a company was looking for a label to tap into this new thing, and they said, 'Who can we get?' And they asked around and somebody said get Marty Thau. Marty gets a call. They said, we'd like you start a label, because we know you're here on the scene. We know you go out to all these clubs. You know what's happening around this new punk scene, and Marty gets to the office in the building on 52nd St. and step aside just about. Most of us had played Red Star Records and we were right there, being the first album at Red Star and we're all sloshed.

**Interviewer 1** I was wondering whether Craig had influenced your echoey stuff or you had chosen him, because he worked with echoey stuff.

**Martin Rev** We were working. We never really could get a cheap echoplex that doesn't add to the sound here and there, and it would sound half as cool. He would just put it on Alan's voice and when Craig just said, we got it to the studio. He said, "Let's take off all your effects, put it straight and clean, and then we'll put the effects on it. I didn't know Craig from echo, or not, but he was basically, Marty pretty much knew our sound so I think he hinted to the fact that we're gonna try some echoes with the voice, and the rest stay with distortion so that he hooks up some devices, and I didn't know anything about Craig's history at all.

**Interviewer 2** You made a good choice.

**Martin Rev** Yeah, Barney knew of him quite well before. They were close friends. So Barney came in one day. He said he was thinking about who he had to produce now that he had a record, do a record with us, and he said, how about Craig Leon, and I said we don't know who else to get so let's try him.

**Interviewer 1** At that point in time we were lucky to get anybody, right?

**Martin Rev** That's right.

**Interviewer 1** So Alan talked about the Reverend B thing just really recently actually and I've always been intrigued and they're like well put that down, your Reverend B Band.

**Martin Rev** Well, at that time, I had been playing of course gigs since I was 15, but I had group called The Reverend B which was a total, free electronic jazz group, and by that time I had processed through all the stages of jazz. After rock I went to jazz or tried to. Oh, I think that's really it. Let me do that. Well, you know what? Do something like that, what amounts to something like jazz, modern classical. Maybe 8, 10 years down the line then you've gotta replay them. So maybe 6, 7 years later I processed through all the stages, bebop. Basically my own time right before late bebop, and even Bird at that time was too early for me.

**Martin Rev** So it was like Miles, Train, and then through Cecil Taylor and the [inaudible 00:05:15] and we went like total free shit with electronic keyboards. Everybody had keyboards anyway, and I had a few people I knew from here and there and I knew people. So I'd bring in different settings because [inaudible 00:05:31] were like artists. I think that night when Alan first started we used a couple trumpets, maybe two drummers, a couple of saxes, and myself, electric organ, and we did several things when we could. I called it Reverend B because I figured that was hip because [inaudible 00:05:58] and looking for shows. Somebody very auspiciously [inaudible 00:06:00]. I had seen the names around somewhere.

**Martin Rev** I thought it was kind of an interesting name for a loft music thing. He said I can get you a show there, and the next day she called. She was a friend of my wife's. So when she called, she said, my friend's father turns out to be a head of [inaudible 00:06:23]. But nobody knew them a few years ago but he's running radical slideshow events and [inaudible 00:06:28]. He was like a Persian prince or something. We thought he was so radical, you know. One time I came up to him. I said, "Why don't we just get some guns. Let's just go out. Let's just fucking run our [inaudible 00:06:45]". He said, "Man, what are you just gonna jerk off like a fucking school boy. Can't just be like that." I'm just gonna piss around like a kid, but that was the times, and you'd seem them every day, the people coming off the streets, getting high, against the war. It was art work. It was coalition of anybody. It was all these radical coalition groups, guerrilla groups probably.

**Interviewer 2** I remember going as the women's liberation days. [inaudible 00:07:19]

**Martin Rev** So, Reverend B kind of came there that way, and then I think Alan had the second gig, because after that I heard they were looking for someone to do this actually a party event, and I sat down, and it took [inaudible 00:07:44] in an office with the board of directors, which, they didn't like us, and they hired me to do the show. It was like 25 bucks [inaudible 00:08:07]

**Interviewer 2** $25 went a long way then.

**Interviewer 1** Having a really big band try to get him a little pay too.

**Martin Rev** Yeah, no, everybody got paid something like-

**Interviewer 1** Divided by ten too.

**Martin Rev** I remember that night was, we took a break, and some guys I knew from high school I hadn't seen in years, several years. It felt like many years, but it wasn't, actually showed up to the gig. They saw something in the paper. I was flying. We hadn't seen each other since high school. One had been to Vietnam and been released and come out and another came, and they came with their girlfriends. It was incredible. So my old friend, Billy, came round the side, I was taking a break and he turned me on to hash. So I went back out and did my set, and right now it's getting later.

**Martin Rev** It's incredible. You go into a groove, total hallucinatory thing, and that's what Alan was talking about when he first [inaudible 00:08:56] I turn around at some point, and Alan's [inaudible 00:09:00] she's playing a tambourine, hitting a tambourine. So I turned around to him, and when it was all over, I said, "Alan, you and I are going to do something together." It's only because I knew by that time, because we had run into each other previously at Museum a little bit.[inaudible 00:09:23] He saw that I was playing. I came in.

**Martin Rev** I heard what they were trying to do, and he was gonna be the only one who was gonna be up as late as I was, searching... Looking for something. Everybody else was going home regular hours. The artists would show their stuff and go home at five, and Alan, he'd get after some of the other more radical artists. They don't go home, and Alan and I just flew out on a street or at the museum looking for getting high. The next thing to ourselves individually, because we met as individuals even though we were already [inaudible 00:10:01]

**Interviewer 1** I love in the interview when he says, "Pete, find a Marty." How do you find a Marty? And for me and Pat, I found a Pat. We collaborated for 40 years, and if you can find a partner to create art with, it's an amazing gift.

**Martin Rev** Well at that time, there was the space, having the space to do music and have a space to just drag in some instruments which was the drums for me at first and be able to just play.

**Interviewer 1** I can't picture you as a drummer.

**Martin Rev** It was our first gig, with the hat, the 60's rock hat, sitting there on a trap drum, a set of traps. I had a stripped down set of traps that my kid had. I'd throw a couple in the duffel bag, and it's stand and ride cymbal and hi hat and bass drum but that was the way I wanted to do it first, just start. I was doing, it wasn't four weeks. I didn't come in the same guy for four weeks. It was maybe one night, and I just listened to them. I figured they're trying to do something here.

**Martin Rev** They're trying to do something here. Paul, the guitar player, was a visual artist. He used to mix [inaudible 00:11:29] guitar. Alan had his head in a Wollensak tape recorder. You know it used head plugs. Okay, doesn't make a difference, but tried to squeeze out feedback. That's when I walk in. So I saw them for the first time. I had just come from audition, Reverend B, a stripped down version of Reverend B. So he told me you can do an audition. They have him as London Records. London Records had an office right around the corner from the Museum.

**Interviewer 1** They had a lot of blue stamps.

**Martin Rev** They labeled, yeah.

**Interviewer 1** They had blue labels.

**Martin Rev** A major label, so I don't know who had H and S but they set up an audition for London Records for me and three other Reverend... Total Cecil and [inaudible 00:12:17]

**Interviewer 1** They had like costumes, like record gold quality...

**Martin Rev** Oh no, no, we never wore costumes. We just fucking played, hot shit. Of course, they were very polite, but no, I don't think it's gonna work for our label. So everybody else goes home, and here are four other guys [inaudible 00:12:35] had to bring their whole band because they weren't getting paid or anything obviously, and I walk out, and everybody goes home, and we're wandering around, and we stop up to the Museum because I know the team meets there [inaudible 00:12:49] and get off the street to see what's happening. So I go in the elevator.

**Martin Rev** I ride amazingly easy to lock elevators for the office building. The elevator was open. So we pressed four or whatever it was, and when I get out all I hear is squeaking and feedback, and so I look over, and it's a big space, maybe 500 square feet, and there's just two guys. Alan's back, leaning down into a Wollensak tape recorder trying to turn the dials, and Paul just hitting the guitar trying to get sound every time. So I listen for a while, and then I walked around, and I found some industrial springs, because it was a loft that was still finished but not.

**Martin Rev** So I sat down on the other side. The space was great. It was so big you could just relax. I had no place to go. I had just flunked another audition, so that was good and it's unexpected, you always have your hopes up. I just sat around across from them, probably about 50 feet away, just started to, these industrial springs make a drum and start to direct it like it's rock and roll, and we met soon after that night or whatever. It was always the place to go to get off the street. It was downtown. At the time, I was living uptown, and there was always something happening at the Museum, and everybody would split, and Alan and I were the last ones.

**Martin Rev** We'd hang out with the music. We'd talk about art and music stuff until the light came, split three or four in the morning, and then we'd always walk to this bakery on the west side of the village off of 7th Ave. When they're just putting out their bread in the store. It was our breakfast. The bakery was just opening up, the Italian bakery, and Alan was staying in Brooklyn, and he said the funeral parlor was a friend of his family and let him stay in the basement, and I would split uptown so we'd take the train and the next night, we both were at the same place. We had nothing to do. We really had no work, except I'd be playing all day in my room. I had an old keyboard, upright grand piano. At night I'd just come down looking to get off the streets. It was probably about that time, and Alan was doing the same thing, but Alan was one of the board of directors he said of the place.

**Interviewer 1** Of the space, he was on the board of directors at the space.

**Martin Rev** Yeah, but the space was like two or three, the board of directors, and most of them never showed up, and it was a painter named Joe Catuccio great painter whose vowed never to have a show. He was like Michelangelo. He did these large, incredibly large paintings... scenes. They were getting ideas out of comic books then. They'd just internalize it. It would come out like he was brought up in Connecticut by the industrial towns in Connecticut. The American landscape. Like Fresco was on canvas, but he hasn't... He never showed his life. [inaudible 00:16:05] One time he was, he'd still be there, and even he'd leave, and then Alan, because Alan at that time started to supplement his sleep in the office. So it was [inaudible 00:16:21] his name was, his friend with the funeral parlor. It was a funeral parlor that was converted into a brownstone and he bought. So Alan would sleep there sometimes too now. So that was his new home, and so that was our space. We had a space just to hang out and to do what we did.

**Interviewer 1** When did you play CBGB's first? Did you have to audition? Did you have to go Tuesday and do auditions like...

**Martin Rev** Oh, no. We never auditioned. You know how we played CBGB's first? There's a group called The Fast.

**Interviewer 1** I remember them.

**Martin Rev** Yeah, and The Fast championed us. It was kids from Brooklyn out of a family of three brothers.

**Interviewer 1** [inaudible 00:17:26]

**Martin Rev** Yeah, zones, and they played. They loved The Who, and they played really fast poppy stuff, light pop, but good, tight. You could tell they rehearsed all the time. All these groups at the time on the scene were all kind of diverse and hadn't... were just starting to find a place. Cities didn't become cities yet. It was a little couple months before. There was a Hell's Angels party. You walk in there anytime during the day, it was a total hippy party, and Hell's Angels kind of... Kelly lived in the back with his dogs.

**Interviewer 2** The Salukis.

**Interviewer 1** He used to bring on the subway. He just would go on the subway with two dogs, like it was normal. He never even said anything. He just took the dogs everywhere.

**Martin Rev** He apparently dropped out of the music business. I found out later he had been working with Don Shaeffer. He was a major promoter. He used to do those big Central Park things, those TV things. That was what he was coming up... That's what he was into, and one day he said to himself, that's it. I've had it with this business. Like Marty Thau left the business too. Marty Thau was a big, big success coming out of school [inaudible 00:18:15] He was working for Lawrence Levy. [inaudible 00:18:18] and one time he told me they gave him a bonus for a Christmas present at his home in Scarsdale. [inaudible 00:18:27]

**Interviewer 1** He didn't get any [inaudible 00:18:33] at CBGB's.

**Martin Rev** And just one day he said, that's it. I'm not working for the industry. I can't do this corporate thing anymore. He left his wife, his kids. They were probably [inaudible 00:18:44] and he got an apartment downtown, and he started looking and booking bands, and he still took in from '72 at least to five good years until he was ready to work with us. Wow, that band is fucking crazy, incredible. They could never make a record, and one day he heard the single. We put on Max's in a cut. He cut, and then I took out [inaudible 00:19:09] at H45. Because Max's [inaudible 00:19:12] the Tommy Dean, the street level Max's not the pop art Max's open in Mickey Ruskin wouldn't even let us in sometimes to get a turn.

**Martin Rev** He started putting on our television single on the jukebox and I walked up to Tommy Dean, who was [inaudible 00:19:27] I said, Tommy, can we put a single too? He said, yeah, go ask Peter Crowley. Give it to Peter Crowley. Peter Crowley was the curator of the day [inaudible 00:19:39] Max's because he knew exactly what was happening with these bands that nobody else knew. So we cut the next day. I told Alan, let's cut. We had this little five inch reel Wollensak tape recorder another one because he didn't have a basement. We cut up two tracks, 'Rocket U.S.A.' and 'Keep Your Dreams', I think we called it then. Too bad the 48th St. you could still go, in those days... It was still there where you could get a tape or a cassette anything and they'll cut you an acid vinyl if you want a 78, 45, you were still there probably from the days when these are plugged songs. The 30's and 20's. And I came out with a single two copies. That night I went to Max's as usual.

**Interviewer 1** It's an empire. With the gold record.

**Martin Rev** Yeah at Empire Records. I forget they put a label on it? A bit of an orange and black label on the thing. You write the name of the song. And I said, "Hey Peter, I got a single." He should show. So Marty, having dinner one night, it's five, six years later. Story goes as he told it. Yes I'm like, who is that? He said, "Susan, they can make a record. They can make records." Marty was as much as anything still a record man. He came under that umbrella Morris Mayhem, that whole new world. The record business and the next day he called up. He had just got back from Boston. He paid somebody twenty bucks to drive us across to play the Rat.

**Interviewer 1** I still love the Rat. They had a great sound system. Mama said they had CDs.

**Martin Rev** That's right. And it's a real street level rock club, mid-century, and we drove back at 4:00 in the morning. The next day we got a call. Marty flat out wants to start managing us. So, but your original question was something.

**Interviewer 1** Do you have to audition in front of audiences?

**Martin Rev** Absolutely not. We wouldn't have done it. Not in CBGB's.

**Interviewer 1** You know we could make it that way.

**Martin Rev** Oh. Tremendous.

**Question 3** They used to terrify me at CBGC's. I was really-

**Martin Rev** Like Rita said, beneath the underground...

**Interviewer 1** I was really, really scared too at CBGB's.

**Martin Rev** Tried that before.

**Interviewer 1** Why don't you describe some of the early shows.

**Martin Rev** The Fast. They got gigs from Hilly and before it was CBGB's, Hilly hadn't been officially... it was still a Hell's Angels hangout and Hilly was starting to [inaudible 00:22:29] branding, thinking about, I guess obviously starting a club for Country Bluegrass. Country Blue's and Bluegrass, that's what CBGB's meant. Absolutely no punk that was Hilly and he did, he said that. So fans love this, I don't know where it came from. You never know. The cars cruised out of nowhere and the fans were in same street as we were but they were such a pop, clean, family group.

**Interviewer 1** They wore a little [inaudible 00:22:36] right? Didn't they have little mod-

**Martin Rev** Very mod, very-

**Interviewer 1** Really cool shoes.

**Martin Rev** Yeah.

**Interviewer 1** I remember those.

**Martin Rev** But they really dug that we were just really, I guess, personally in Brooklyn town.

**Interviewer 1** Right.

**Martin Rev** So they used to invite us to these gigs. They had us open up for them for a weekend at CBGB's. That was the first time we got in over here. We did two sets a night each.

**Interviewer 1** But you played at CB's a lot, though.

**Martin Rev** After a while.

**Interviewer 1** I saw you there a lot.

**Martin Rev** Max's was really our club and he just started bringing us into Max's, building us up during the week. Okay. Maybe we make 50 bucks, maybe the two of us together. He eventually put us... Okay, now you open up for this band on Friday night. I called Peter Cole one time I started as a band was club cole before Max's, when Max's closed and Mickey had to close the club. It was close to a year. So there was a little club on 23rd St. called Mother's.

**Interviewer 1** Tell me about Mother's.

**Martin Rev** All right, so now walking around we went through and okay, there's no prospects, no nothing so look [inaudible 00:24:21]. That's how it was. You were lucky to find one place that wasn't doing [inaudible 00:24:29]. My gig was just getting to nobody knows you.

**Martin Rev** So, I stopped at a pay phone and I call and I ask for whoever's hiring or tell them that we're a band. The guy gets on the phone and I said we're a band called 'Suicide', do you think maybe we can get a shot at a gig at Mother's. It was Peter Crowley. They had just hired him to book there. And Peter says to me over the phone, "Yeah, there's another group who wasn't signed," or something like that. And he goes, "And you can play with them," and such and such. He says, "But you going to headline." Because he already knew of us. That's how Peter works.

**Martin Rev** We weren't anything at that time, like I say, beneath the underdog, but Peter already had investigated in so much on his [inaudible 00:25:18] background turns out for the living fear and working at puppetry electronic dance and stuff, he came back to New York for work. He came for longer and then Tommy Dean, predludes records with Marty Thau, now takes over Max's. It's closed for a year.

**Martin Rev** Then, the syndicates or what not, take it over in the first place. We said, now it's a fucking place [inaudible 00:25:46] The home of pop, color and what not. Vietnam now has ended. Anybody's down to see our flat shoes. Everything's changed. Now it's about making enough money to eat that day. Working class values. Before it was about escaping, that's why it was so cold we... Especially the glamor under it. It's Vietnam, Vietnam, year, after year, after year. It causes escapism. Everybody dresses more colorfully, things that the old people would never take as seriously except the Suicide [inaudible 00:26:25] fucking horrible.

**Martin Rev** So, now Tommy's looking for, who can I get that's knows the scene out there I don't know anything about it. I need a booker. Somebody says, Peter Crowley. I guess there's not many callers like Peter Crowley working at Mother's brings over the masses. Peter starts... He creates the whole scene at Max's and that eventually... We start getting invited out to CB's sometimes, we do shows with [inaudible 00:26:55] and the Ramones. But it wasn't our natural club. Max's was a real Long Island, Vegas kind of... Our official environment that you just love to hang out at because they had booths and rugs and restaurants and you could sit there all night with friends. But it wasn't... CB's was authentic. All wood and no windows, dogs running around smelling of beers. No dress room. There never was a dress room, even after they changed the sound system, upgraded it, did work on that, which was great. There's still no dressing room. The first gig we did with the Fast we were in Hilly's bedroom in the back of the stage. With one of those dogs, like Dalmatians.

**Interviewer 2** You know the name... Salukis.

**Interviewer 1** They're long, thin... I think, Egyptian dogs.

**Interviewer 2** They look like dobermans to me. But they're skinny. And they used to poop in the club. [crosstalk 00:28:03] But it was really nasty.

**Martin Rev** If you wanted to get sick just go to CB's for ten minutes go hear a band rock out. Ten minutes you come out with something.

**Interviewer 2** And they used to sell food. They had chilli and burgers. And I swear I'd pay Hilly to cook some kind of...

**Martin Rev** Must have really lied around the city.

**Interviewer 2** Maybe we should ask the audience if they have some questions. We're just chatting away up here. Anybody have any questions for us and are ready?

**Question 4** [inaudible 00:28:45]

**Martin Rev** That's a neat question.

**Interviewer 1** Did anybody hear that?

**Question 4** I was just asking what the set up was in '78 with his rig and what he was using the first drum machine.

**Martin Rev** 78 was already a drum machine and an organ... It was... I started a [inaudible 00:29:08] that somebody gave me, let me buy very cheap. Turned out to be a composer from France and he was [inaudible 00:29:16] and better friends with Alan than I was at the time and so the first tour was at or when we did Red Star, first record we actually had equipment budget. There's only so much money. We had an advance for $2000 or something like that. No, really. We were struggling... It was just incredible. And Marty said that we can get you some equipment with... Here's an extra grand because Taylor Records was the umbrella company was giving funding to our operation.

**Martin Rev** So, I went out and bought another organ which was a Fox. The colors were black and white, black into that white. And that's the one, I believe, I took on the 78 tour with the first drum machine, I'm pretty sure, or the second one that I bought. Because the first one Alan didn't quite have the story right. First of all, it wasn't new. I wanted to get a real machine for sometime but I couldn't afford one. I couldn't even afford one used.

**Martin Rev** So every once in a while, I'd look at a selling post you know the buy lines that you used to... And searching, searching. I'd find one maybe... Definitely less than $50. I've seen one now it's 30 bucks. I don't know anything about it. It's a Siel Cruise. So, I call up. It's a big ride out on train. Way out [inaudible 00:30:40] Long Island. And he said you come out here. I took the trip and went out there. He took me down to the basement where it was. I turned it on. Immediately, that's it. There it is. It was a baby. It was a [inaudible 00:30:57] It's only six, seven beats, volume and a tempo dial. And really, when I heard that first one [inaudible 00:31:09]. I said fine, it's 30 bucks. It's just about what I had. Really nice people, older couple.

**Martin Rev** So, now they tell me something that blew my mind. They told me that belonged to our daughter who... I think she was 15 maybe 19 at the most. She used to write poetry. So, this drum machine, it was her drum machine. So, first I said to myself, "Holy shit. What a... Wow, was she ahead. A girl 19 or less writing poetry. We're talking about '75 to a drum machine. And then they said and she committed suicide just about a month or two ago.

**Martin Rev** So, that's the story of the drum machine. I didn't tell them I'm getting it for my band that's called Suicide. But just how coincidental can you get. That was the one and I took it back and set it up in the museum and that night we had such... Just playing it was still rehearsal and that's just [inaudible 00:32:25]. I plug it in and I play it. It's right there. Alan has it right away. That was it. Was it wrapped in anything or maybe I had it wrapped in a duffel.

**Interviewer 2** That's an amazing coincidence. Anybody else?

**Question 2** [inaudible 00:32:54]

**Interviewer 2** A biopic about Suicide on TV. Oh, a movie. You know anything about that?

**Martin Rev** I'm afraid I don't. Recently?

**Question 2** [inaudible 00:32:58]

**Interviewer 2** Oh, well. He said someone was talking about it on Twitter.

**Martin Rev** It might be [inaudible 00:33:18] 40 years ago.

**Interviewer 1** Capture the feeling of the period in these movies or the horrible. What's that name of that show on TV?

**Interviewer 2** Vinyl.

**Interviewer 1** The CBGB's movie. They're trying but they haven't really been able to capture this feeling or the look or anything about the time. A biopic on Suicide, that would be a real stretch.

**Martin Rev** [inaudible 00:33:46]

**Interviewer 2** Anymore questions?

**Question 3** [inaudible 00:34:03]

**Martin Rev** The Hanson showed up. It may have been before we met or right around the time. The only familiarity at that time was the successful wave of the art world. Except for on your car which was like a third gig. And Ivan brought us in just looking at us and came off the street and he knew Alan already because he gave Alan a show right off the street. Ivan was that kind of a person. A total maverick. And by now, he was the top of the art world. The whole pop up movement he took with him because [inaudible 00:34:44] He used to drive an ice cream truck. [inaudible 00:34:55]

**Martin Rev** So, we had no place to play... So Alan said, "Let's go down to Ivan's for the afternoon, and we just walk in. I don't know where... Alan tries to look respectable. He hadn't shaved in about three days. Letting it all go. By then, I don't who I'm seeing and I don't even care so I got on a baseball jacket, suicide pair of drumsticks in my belt loops. And Alan says, very politely, "Ivan, we'd like to do a gig... show here." Ivan never puts on shows so I said, [inaudible 00:35:31]. He takes a look at us, he comes out of his office and turns to his assistant. He says, "Print up invitations for such and such a night [inaudible 00:35:41] music." They told music by Suicide, whatever it was, genius I think it was, printed it up, sent it out to the entire mailing list [inaudible 00:35:47].

**Martin Rev** And, that was the art world, which was so, by that time, the lead. I remember going to a gallery to check out a show. I was sitting against the wall for about half an hour with my shades over my face. A whole different world but it was [inaudible 00:36:10] a money world. So Duane Hanson... I think around the time I knew Alan, because he had a little more connections now that he was showing Ivan a back room here. And so, I don't know, a group show. Ivan had walked in where I started... to the museum one night. That's the way Ivan was. He was the biggest, greatest entrepreneur ever in New York post [inaudible 00:36:42]. Photographing, Real Estate, everything came to Ivan. Pop up [inaudible 00:36:48].

**Martin Rev** But he still would look in the papers and if he saw something, a little thing. We used to put in these tiny, little ads for Suicide, it's all we could afford with five bucks. And the museum put in an ad for an art show they were having. They must have mentioned Alan's life sculpture that he calls them. So, Ivan, he really hates to do this but that's the way he was, Marty Thau too. So he would go out and check out these kind of shows. They were all these fucking places out of nowhere to them. And he walked in one night and he said, "How was the shows... how is the work?" So, Alan, from having no prospects at all, nothing, Ivan walks in and he says, "I got a show," wherever it was. "I'll give you guys a small room outside. Bigger than I'll give you a show." Just books it in like that.

**Martin Rev** So, and then Alan, he had already shown, I think the first time was, maybe his first... Still had his friends coming out to see it. But Ivan still had Duane Hanson because we came in one time when the museum was a basement with Ivan. Alan was living underneath there now. The museum had moved from [inaudible 00:38:05] place to a bigger square foot gallery to a basement/loft kind of thing. Smaller and he started running sketch classes. Teaching a painter or something.

**Martin Rev** He came up with the idea... He had a brilliant idea to run sketch classes three four times a week, which he did for years. Paid the rent, paid his... my friend to live. And Alan was living in a little room that wasn't even a room and he just put up some walls on the side. There was no ceiling and he'd draw in a sleeping bag, whatever. And that was his space. And that's where we would record the tapes [inaudible 00:38:45].

**Martin Rev** So, one day in his... There's a Pieta. A modern Pieta. And he tells me, Duane Hanson, who I wasn't familiar with Duane had given him, as a gift, this piece and to trade for one of Alan's sculptures. And it filled... It was basically the whole room and it was big. And you walk in and it was an incredible piece. It was, if you think about it, probably worth quite a bit. Other than that I don't know... I couldn't fill you in too much.

**Question 3** [inaudible 00:39:56]

**Martin Rev** That Alan put together?

**Question 3** No. [inaudible 00:40:09]

**Martin Rev** Okay. I'm not familiar with that show, so that's probably wrong.

**Question 3** [inaudible 00:40:22]

**Martin Rev** It was very coincidental. Also, surprising. It surprises me because Duane was a well, by that time, a respected artist who came from Florida and was doing these big works that took a lot of... And showing them. Like in Ivan's, I'm sure, doing very well. He was established then.

**Question 3** [inaudible 00:40:50]

**Martin Rev** Incredible culture. It was the center of the art world still. [inaudible 00:41:14] came and what I figured out was that there were two [inaudible 00:41:19] New York and now it's abstract expressionism, center of the art world because they're not just a visual art. There's dance, music, classical, jazz. Everything, everybody, all the great masters of the world came to New York and so, that was the plus side.

**Martin Rev** The only desolate side, really, was the reality from, as there always probably was, was poverty for those who were poor. In the 70's they downgraded economics theory. It was the reality that New York's bonds were downgraded in the 70's because the economy was considered risk-worthy.

**Martin Rev** So, that was the side... It was a mint time. After the 60's there was a limbo period. After the 60's rock it was just an empty gap and that's where punk comes in through.

**Interviewer 1** I think that was very geographical too. They pretty much abandoned us, in terms of garbage pick up. Everything was less. We had less mailboxes, we had less garbage picked up. We just had less everything and it was great.

**Martin Rev** You can find those streets... There's a lot of those streets now the same way. You've just gotta know where to look. If you go one direction you're gonna have people out for bars and restaurants and clubs. [inaudible 00:42:53] $60 salad. In Wall Street area, forget it.

**Interviewer 2** There's 2 million more people in New York now.

**Interviewer 1** Population density. And a lot of them are on my block. On Orchard Street there's now like four 22-storey hotels. One next to me, one across the street from me, one down the block. People with rolling cases running over my dog all the time. It's so changed, but you live in New York, you can't go around griping about change, because you came here because you wanted change. You bring your change here. But it's really different. It's unbelievably crowded. Just people everywhere but you can still find empty streets at night.

**Interviewer 1** Remember Tribeca at night. You would walk from blocks and not see anybody.

**Question 4** [inaudible 00:43:58]

**Martin Rev** Well, first of all I never had an aesthetic during a concert. Alan, most of the conceptualization comes after you see what you do and you say, now I can make a theory. I can say with Suicide with the group it would be five different things. I first started the name we decided we wanted to call it Suicide. First time I said yes. I had no theory... I couldn't... Because just... It was there. It was the energy. The night before we went over about 3000 names and every one was funnier than the other. We were higher and higher. We were cranking up all night, we were sitting in Washington Square Park. We left and without any of them. We had no name. Great fucking night, laughing like crazy.

**Martin Rev** And the next day we come up on Suicide. And the conception is, coming off the street, like Alan says, we were [inaudible 00:45:01] the street. He saw what he was doing but he was already on the street. He was living in the museum, he was living in... Once he saw Hilly, like he said, he decided that he could not be an artist anymore unless he performs. And he left his comfortable existence which is a marriage [inaudible 00:45:24] middle class and upper-middle class in Brooklyn Heights, worked out of his college working for the city every job like that after an incredible education it was just art, art, art. Visual art. And he... Everything came down crumbling, like a [inaudible 00:45:42] he gone from suddenly painter to a painter. He jumps out the car with his wife and kids... Such a comfortable upper bougeoir he's living dressed well. Ties, middle class.

**Martin Rev** And then run into the country side he asks the driver to stop for a second. He says to his wife, "Goodbye, my dear," jumps off the car and that's it. And there he was in Paris without a dime. So that's how it was for us. That's how it was for me. My life was even more intense than Alan's. Still single then.

**Martin Rev** I was a young kid. I was married with kids. It's an incredible [inaudible 00:46:35]. We got around. Loved the... obsessed with the romance of music and art and life. So when we came on the stage, speaking for myself, that was the energy that came on the stage. Because we were doing something that wasn't... It was so different they weren't regular instruments people used to get attached.

**Martin Rev** We were coming, right after the big rock era, where everybody's used to a certain thing. We come on like this on a stage. Nobody knows you, first of all. It's a new band. I guess a little band that has an attitude like this with no instruments that you're used to and we play with that kind of energy because that's the life we were living. And if you don't like it, we play even harder because [inaudible 00:47:28] if you don't like us. If you hear them for the first time I thought, Wow, finally we're going to get respect [inaudible 00:47:41] an artist, like the jazz guys [inaudible 00:47:43]. For the first time in my life being an artist.

**Martin Rev** So, it was a riot. Then we went on Tour for two months. The first stop was the [inaudible 00:48:01] we had one song here. We stopped over the bearings, the label. A mad science fiction festival. It's an intellectual festival. [inaudible 00:48:11] that's the kind of festival it was. Picture a smaller room like this, stage about six inches high, very intimate. Audience was there. We were into maybe our second or third track, our audience is throwing shit. Alan had to get off. Many times in the day. It was so hot. I was so excited I keep playing because that's... They're losing the theater is also for the acting. Losing the theater is also for the one on stage. You got 2000 people that are just hating your fucking guts and you're coming closer to [inaudible 00:48:57] and jumping on the chicken. Imagine what they're going to do to you if they're jumping on chicken where skinned it... to skin you. I don't play [inaudible 00:49:15].

**Martin Rev** That's the magic and illusion of the theater for the [inaudible 00:49:21] on the stage. Besides the audience. But you do have something that's powerful too. You got that sound that's here. But hopefully you have the security. And, so that's was the hardest day... The energy wasn't living. It was supposed to be where... We had already been hardest in our own right. Alan was [inaudible 00:49:48] I wasn't ready. We had been limiting individual... So committed. Obsessed. We never took a risk. I personally never took a risk. As a matter of fact I never took a risk in my life. As a kid going through this, oh you can't do this, you can't do this, you gotta ask something else fall back on [inaudible 00:50:07]. I'm doing this.

**Martin Rev** So, by the time, before Alan of course, [inaudible 00:50:16] nothing. I'm going further and further from the mainstream. Teenagers don't leave home. Everybody else my age is either still in school. Forget about girls. Girls are still living at home or still in college. I leave school. All of a sudden I find myself living in studio with my baby grand piano that I'm hanging off. I'm totally isolated because you want to seize [inaudible 00:50:40] and that's your vision and all of a sudden you break up one day and [inaudible 00:50:40] which I knew had all these [inaudible 00:50:40]. It was one of those times when there wasn't many and we both... That's what happens when you're obsessed with something that's not necessarily [inaudible 00:50:43]. Most artists they go through when they're as committed.

**Martin Rev** So, that's who we both were as individuals already. Alan had been doing it for several years in Long Island. He knew there was nothing he was going to... Especially now [inaudible 00:51:27] but even before that he knew he was going to be an artist. Right away, he had to make a living. And he said, if I'm going to make a living I've gotta get out here and start finding some paying for something. I've gotta... just playing and taking [inaudible 00:51:41].

**Martin Rev** It was a constant personal evolution. You offer them one thing. All I've got is jazz. [inaudible 00:51:44] rock and roll.

**Martin Rev** But the energy that's who I was and it was... And later, we could say it was Vietnam, it was [inaudible 00:52:11] definitely the name taking the subway since I was a baby. Definitely is a [inaudible 00:52:19] that stays with you. New York's an incredibly exciting city for a kid. Plus the culture is the best place with some of the greatest masters of music. We were living ten minutes to most of them. And still... that scene is still alive.

**Martin Rev** It was exiting. Some of those stations you could see them on 8th Street. They did it up. They shined the little bits up in the tiles. They were like movie sets for those film noir cop and robber fucking movies from the 40's. I took a subway and it was exciting and there were still gangs. Gangs for days... They were just gangs looking to fucking take your watch if you wore one which I never did, but just rob you. Gangs for days. Sportsmen.

**Interviewer 1** [inaudible 00:53:31]

**Martin Rev** That's right. The [inaudible 00:53:31]. Gangs was your [inaudible 00:53:31] and you got into the subway.

**Interviewer 1** So, anyway I was thinking when you were saying you've gone to Europe and you're like oh waiting to be recognized as an artist. What about 2010 when you went and played at Barbican and you played... They wanted you to play the whole... your first to albums and I think that you probably were recognized as artists. What did that feel like?

**Martin Rev** I think it wasn't Barbican. It was the Anna Smith. It was... That's an incredible coincidence of synchronicity too because now, especially for Alan. We agreed finally, Paul Smith was working with us for some time. He really wanted me to go back and wanted us to do the first album on the original instrument. I knew it right away, it's not going to work. I told him it's not gonna work going back to the original instruments. One thing he had then, that we're not going to have now for me, the energy. It's gotta have the same energy. You want to put this in the museum under glass, and even then it's not going to work. But to go on stage and start, oh but there's so many people who never heard you then. A new generation.

**Martin Rev** So, I put it off for about... couple of years to the frustration of everybody and eventually Alan, too. So I said, "Let's just do it." I said, "If I'm going to do this at all, it's going to be on the [inaudible 00:55:04] On the instruments I'm playing right now. But I don't know if it'll work but if I get a chance, I'll play around and see if it works."

**Martin Rev** So, at one point I did and a thing came up, ATP booked a lot of parties, just tons of gigs and finally folded. [inaudible 00:55:23]. So, Paul Smith got a gig at this old resort. I didn't want to explore but that's another name from as a kid. And we played as kids the first one, and the first album and it's incredible. And the reaction was just like it was 20 or 30 years before. People say after, because ATP staying around for three days. People who are all these different bands and then you all get to know each other as the bands living here.

**Martin Rev** So, people come and they give you feedback about two days later. They tell me, man, it was like I wanted to leave but I couldn't leave. I was so suffocated but I couldn't stay... I had to stay but first day but they were here after first time. But for us it worked totally so, now the ATP comes saying we got a gig in May [inaudible 00:56:27] raw power. And he would like, we would like, how would you like to get Suicide open up for two nights doing the first album. So that was, I think that's the one you're-

**Interviewer 1** Anna Smith.

**Martin Rev** [inaudible 00:56:44] the last gig.

**Interviewer 1** Is that videotaped?

**Martin Rev** That's a good question. The theater did the projections on my set. Because we used to do solo sets and group sets. She said [inaudible 00:57:01] And I don't know if anybody ever... I would think they had... I'm not sure.

**Interviewer 1** So what's up for you now? In 2017 you [crosstalk 00:57:20]

**Martin Rev** Nothing's changed. I've been gaining about an average of the way I wanna do it, one a month. Sometimes more, sometimes less. When I want, where I want to do it. I just came back from L.A. It was an incredible thing. They show you films as part of the next night. Did a gig there, set up [inaudible 00:57:47].

**Martin Rev** So, I been playing, thinking and growing, new recor... Not trying to plug anything because that doesn't fucking matter. New record just happened to come out.

**Interviewer 1** Plug that new record.

**Martin Rev** No, I don't give a shit. The somebodies here is that I love to hear what you hear, where you hear this. I know where I hear shit but I love hearing what other people are hearing. People are jacked up and sometimes they find cool ideas. I know what I am hearing. Today, anyway.

**Martin Rev** So, that's just come out and I planned and that's always been my life. That's what I love to do and the person I love is here, also. Between you two. Romance.

**Question 5** How do you feel about putting together the soundtrack with the Warhol movies at the BAM at two years ago?

**Interviewer 1** Can you talk about putting together the soundtrack for the Warhol movies?

**Question 5** That's our last question.

**Martin Rev** We did three in New York and we just did three last year in Europe and you're referring to BAM. Okay, Dean Wareham, you're probably familiar with him from LUNA, originally. I never knew him very well at all but he contacted me. He asked me would I like to do the show because there was going to be Tom Verlaine, his group, Eleanor Friedberger, I believe it is and Bradley Cox. And we're going to have... the Warhol museum has just found eight movies that were all made and nobody's ever seen. And we'd like to have each entity play to three movies, five minutes to be projected. A really large concert hall kind of thing... Museum. And, would you want to do it? And it's all arranged by the museum and it's very... sounded like an interesting thing, so I said, yeah.

**Martin Rev** And, that's how it came about. They sent me... They sent everybody the movies. They could pick the ones... If you didn't like it, you can say, you'd be something else. So they sent me the three. I right away saw... They said, you write three tracks to the three movies.

**Interviewer 1** Were they individual movies. Are they shorts?

**Martin Rev** Yeah. They're five minutes.

**Interviewer 1** That's cool.

**Martin Rev** Warhol was working around at [inaudible 01:00:51] he was photographing people meeting him. People like Nico and other people like that too. So we did that and it was a great reception. We did a band, we did it at Carnegie Hall in fucking, Philadelphia, in Pittsburgh, which was Andy's hometown. And that's where the museum is. Like a nine-storey museum about him.

**Interviewer 1** It's an amazing museum. I did a show there in their fabulous auditorium and it has every single piece of Andy's work. Including that room with the clouds that float around.

**Martin Rev** I was never at the museum. They wanted to take me over and nothing was [inaudible 01:01:07] It was going to be a long day.

**Interviewer 1** Yeah. It's a great museum. Well, it's getting too old to come and...
