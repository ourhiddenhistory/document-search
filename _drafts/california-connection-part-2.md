**Host** The next program you'll be hearing is the California Connection part two, playwright and author, Donald Freed, continues with Professor Richard Popkin to detail the conspiratorial link between the assassinations of the Kennedys, Martin Luther King, and the attempted murder of George Wallace.

New information is revealed concerning the true cause for the Watergate Break-In. Before we start that program, we'd like to ask you to help support KPFA's Watergate coverage, which will be continuing in September when the senate Watergate hearings resume. Here now is to California Connection part two.

**Donald Freed** The Watergate Break-In was nothing but a dramatic incident that was a convenient rallying point for the media. The tip of the iceberg began with the Watergate Break-In. The iceberg itself has to be seen as a vast and monolithic superstructure. I'm talking now only about the tip of the iceberg.

Operation Gemstone has to be described in the terminology, and diagram of a clandestine intelligence operation, exactly as one would describe a coup de man, a stealthy attempt from within the government to take power, or not electoral power, not simply four more years. But the kind of power, which no democracy with its checks and balances allows.

Now, the superstructure that I've abstracted on this chart, and indeed on all of them, is organized crime, corrupt unions, big business, a kind of a label, especially for the multinational organizations, and intelligence fronts. The intelligence front in Operation Gemstone is the committee to reelect the president.

Nixon and Mitchell, Nixon is of course, the representative in every way of these forces, and has been so since he first answered a classified ad to run for Congress. That was many years ago. One of the sponsors of that ad is about to be indicted. He's from San Diego and Dr. Popkin will talk about him.

Mitchell played the role of internal security, the President's agent, that is to say, who was responsible for monitoring what came in, and what flowed out of the White House. The East Coast is represented here by Charles Colson, he would be the equivalent of a station chief in the way that in a foreign country, a diplomat represents the United States' interests.

But the Central Intelligence Agency will work out of the American Embassy in a foreign country. And from there, the clandestine, the training of police, the various propaganda operations will go forward. And of course, these activities center around usually, elections in these countries, as in Chile, for example. Colson would be the equivalent then of the station chief, the man in charge of plans.

And it's as if, of course, that we were simply natives and/or colonized subjects, and a group of settlers, or neocolonialists were organizing in a clandestine manner from within the country, and from within the government to set in motion, the equivalent American style of a military push, or a coup de man, but it would be from within the government, from within power itself.

In the same way that the Reichstag incident was staged after Hitler was Chancellor, not before, but after he was already Chancellor. He had the majority of the vote. What he did not have was dictatorial power. And that is why long after Nixon ran way ahead of McGovern in the polls. It was not stupidity that kept this operation gemstone in motion.

The winning and the reelection of the presidency was only a minor and first step in operation gemstone. Under Colson, comes Gordon Liddy, and he would be known in clandestine terms as the executive cut off. And you can see that it took the most intense pressure to break this compartmentalization down. Liddy, for the longest time, was the beginning and the end of the conspiracy.

And so, the government argued before Judge Sirica, a compartmentalization held until McCord broke. Under Liddy is Hunt, the field cut off, and under Hunt is McCord, the control or agent handler, the man who runs the contract agents in the field.  And under McCord on the East Coast, of course, were YAF, Young Americans for Freedom, Anti-Castro Cubans, and some other right-wing forces.

Almost all associated with the Central Intelligence Agency, not as employees, none of these people exist in the Central Intelligence Agency files. They are what are called contract agents. They do not exist on paper. On the West Coast, Haldeman is the station chief. And when these charts are revised, Ehrlichman will be in that little box with him.

But Haldeman and Ehrlichman are the equivalent of the diplomat at an American mission, or at an American embassy. The diplomatic representation of the White House, Colson is the professional, the super conspirator. Haldeman and the others are, shall we say, consummate and brilliant amateurs, but they are amateurs.

And although they did everything to finance, and forward, and cover up Operation Gemstone, they did not think it up. There was plenty of input, as they like to say, in the advertising agencies that spawned men like Haldeman and Ziegler, and Dean, and others. But this conspiracy is my argument. The argument of the citizens research and investigating committee is the work of a professional.

And the professionals are Colson and Hunt basically, with McCord as the technician. Haldeman and Ehrlichman then would be the equivalent of ambassadors or diplomats. Chapin would be the executive cutoff for the West Coast wing of Operation Gemstone. Chapin and [Strom 00:06:48] rather, they would be the field cutoffs.

Chapin, the executive cutoff, Strom, the field cutoff Donald Segretti, the controller, agent handler, and he would run the agents on the West Coast, the contract agents. Those would have been Black, Chicano Jesus freaks. They were being hired. They were being organized. The final act, the bottom line of Operation Gemstone were riots in the streets in San Diego, sponsored by Agent Provocateur, and violence through the use of explosives with inside the convention hall.

This violence would have been laid at the door of anti-war, liberal, left, radical McGovern forces. The proof would have been a variation on the Pentagon Papers theme. Information in the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington at Watergate would have been leaked from the files tying McGovern to these forces. Where would this information have come from?

And this is new information tonight. That information was being planted on June 16, 17, 1972 when McCord and the others, and evening clothes, and rubber gloves were arrested at gunpoint. That Operation Gemstone was aborted, and we saw only vestigial evidence of it when Agnew and others with the Vietnam Veterans against the war attempted to point out provocation coming from anti-war forces.

Of course, it did not materialize, and they knew it would not. And so, the widespread use of Agent Provocateurs, when San Diego because of ITT and other reasons had to be given up. And the movement was to Miami where the demonstrations could be controlled more perfectly. Then, Cubans and Young Americans for Freedom replaced Black, and Chicano, and Jesus freaks, the contract Agent Provocateurs from the West Coast.

This would in effect have canceled the elections. There would have been an election, but you can expect Nixon to have gotten 95% to 99% of the vote. Had GOP notables lost their lives in explosions inside the GOP convention, and proof been leaked from the DNC that this was tied to McGovern. All intents and purposes that Operation Gemstone would have been in high gear.

And from the POW extravaganza, they would have gone directly into the American Revolutionary Bicentennial program, which was to use tie in labor unions, students, schools, service groups, churches, armed forces groups, American Legion groups, business, industry, banking, savings and loan. Decals would have been spread across the country.

Any group or individual without a decal would have been highly visible as being un-American. It would have been made the McCarthy era look like peanuts because instead of identifying un-American elements, it would simply have identified American elements. That is a fait accompli and the American Bicentennial, which does not come until 1976 was precisely for that reason, began four years early in 1972.

It would have eventuated in parades, in extravaganzas, in torchlight demonstrations, the Leni Riefenstahl films of Hitler Germany in the '30s were being studied by the committee for the American Bicentennial. And we could have looked forward to enormous sports stadium spectaculars with lights, and flags, and excitement, not to say hysteria that would have been modeled very closely on the spectaculars of the Third Reich in Germany in the 1930s.

That was the plan, to go from Gemstone to the POWs, to the Bicentennial. But it was aborted partially, and we now have some small insight. And we must seize this lever, this thin end of the wedge, which the media and other forces have developed, and push as never before. The next chart is the cash flow. Again, organized crime, corrupt unions, big business, intelligence front, the money is washed, as they say in clandestine vocabulary.

Part of it goes into the broken line is the washed money. It goes from Stans to Haldeman and the comeback. On the West Coast, the primary conduit is Haldeman, the President's personal console, Ed Kalmback, to Segretti, to the field agents. In the East coast, it's Liddy to Barker, the Cuban, to the field agents. The money, you can speak forever about it. It goes as deep, and as broad as you wish to discuss.

That's just a very high order abstraction of some of the cash flow. It goes up over $10 million for Operation Gemstone, approximating a third of the some $50 million raised for the reelection of the President. Over $10 million and over 100 field agents identified at this point. This is proof positive that we are not contemplating a budget, or an itinerary, or the recruitment for a break-in have several offices, one in Beverly Hills, one in Washington, several in New York.

The break-in is not even the tip of the iceberg. The last chart is the cover up and which is still in motion. From the White House itself through Ziegler, missing on there is Viva, of course, and the POW, which has to be prominently described. Through Colson, the master of propaganda through Young Americans for Freedom, Viva, right-wing media.

That's the open overt propaganda campaign to cover up the attempt to get Jane Fonda, the attempt to shift the headlines, and so forth. That battle has partially already been lost by the White House. And that of course is what is fatal. And that's why it's terribly important that the urban plan of a slow steady development means everything because in ratio to the amount of time that elapses now is how much can come out.

The covert on the White House, the burning and destruction of documents of course goes Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean, Gray, Peterson and the Justice Department. That's the outright covert destruction of evidence. The buying off, the use of money of bribery and of threats, runs down from Mitchell to Magruder, Kalmbach, Hunt, Dorothy Hunt.

Also, a longtime CIA agent, Howard Hunt's wife who's dead evidence points to her being having been murdered as she tried to get out of Operation Gemstone, and was talking to the press, beginning to talk to the press, she's dead. And from there to the contract agents, who were some of them already in jail, some of them around the country waiting to see whether they would be paid off.

At this point, I'll save whatever else I have to say for a question-and-answer period and introduce someone to you who's a really very extraordinary person. He's well known for his book, which was really, a classic of meticulous research. The Second Oswald, which was serialized in the New York Review of Books and published by Avon, and was the one book that dealt in a popular sense.

For those who didn't understand ballistics, and logistics, and scientific data of Dallas, The second Oswald was shocking and unarguable proof of conspiracy. Besides, he happens to be a very well-known philosopher, and historian, and formerly head of the philosophy department at UCSD, and a very wide-ranging career indeed, in politics, and literature, and history, and philosophy, and someone you're going to enjoy very much, I think, and who it's my pleasure to unleash now, Professor Richard Popkin.

**Richard Popkin** Thank you. And each time when he talks about the Watergate, can't tell what the state of the argument is unless you heard the car radio a minute ago. And so, I spoke up in Los Angeles two weeks ago. But I think things have moved so fast and so far that I'd like to deal with a different aspect of it first today, and I think we'll be dealing with another aspect a week or so from now.

What seems to be the central issue, which is going to be the bombshell of next week, is what is referred to in the original introduction. This 1970 plan to get rid of all the opponents in the United States, plan was stolen from the White House by Mr. Dean. And placed in the safe deposit box. The keys were given the Judge Sirica. The White House, first, apparently didn't know what he had stolen.

I'm not sure they know to this day all that he's stolen since they seem to be mainly concerned about one document. And they've changed when he started asking for their papers back. Good old Judge Sirica offered them their papers back after he Xeroxed them, and gave his set to the Ervin committee, and Senator Symington's committee. It's through Symington that we're beginning to get some clues as to what this is all about.

Senator Symington said on the 22nd of May, this is the most fantastic document I've ever read. He's given a couple of interviews to St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and some to New York Times and The Washington Post. In the meantime, as Nixon and his friends appreciated what had been taken, Nixon were told the latest issue with Time Magazine, got all that remains of his staff, his few remaining friends to work feverishly on this incredible 4,000-Word document that was issued last week.

And it's the first time in the history of the presidency of the United States that anything like this has happened. The President has been issuing a lawyers' brief, won't discuss it, but has to make sure it's on the record before things move too fast. Nixon says and I don't know if people had the patience to go through it. About one-third of the document is on the stolen paper of Mr. Dean.

And Nixon says in his statement, the document spelling out this 1970 plan are extremely sensitive. They include and are based upon assessments of certain foreign intelligence capabilities and procedures, which of course, must remain secret. And if one reads through Nixon's description of the importance of keeping the secret, the main point of his talk, or at least one of the major points is to try and keep this a classified secret document.

Since Nixon's talk, there have been analyses of it. New York Times, The Washington Post, and Time, Newsweek, The London Observer, all based upon leaked information as to what's in this 1970 plan. And just today, this morning, we heard that Senator Ervin is just horrified having read for the first time what this 1970 plan is. Senator Weicker yesterday, was giving a commencement address in Connecticut on it.

And Weicker says about it. We've heard in recent days, there's a slogan within elements of the Justice Department, that the Constitution is not meant to be a suicide pact. And the writing of it in the 1970 plan is to make sure it's not a suicide pact for certain people. But what's the plan? As far as we know, from a New York Times, has published four articles on it.

The Washington Post has had several, Time magazine goes through a fairly careful putting together of it without ever quoting it. That the plan as Nixon tells us throughout of a catastrophic situation in 1970, when the FBI had stopped taking the White House seriously on what it was supposed to investigate. And then New York Times has gotten a fair amount of background that Nixon, when he couldn't get the FBI to take it seriously.

Then, try to get the CIA. The CIA found that what was supposed to be investigated was to find out the foreign sources of the revenue of the students, the Black Panthers, and the Arabs in America. And for some reason the Arabs in America figure very large in this, as we'll see in a moment. The CIA, sent Nixon a 200-page analysis of what he was asking for trying to teach him some elementary sociology.

That the country was in ferment because there are problems in the country. The racism happens to go on. And some people don't like it, that the Vietnam War was going on. And the students didn't like it. And hence, they didn't need foreign support, foreign agitation. They had enough local problems to get them started.

With the FBI and the CIA refusing to cooperate, were then told by Nixon, that the matter was so serious, that he called an emergency meeting of all the chiefs of intelligence of the two large agencies, the FBI, and the CIA, the National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and some other small secret ones, to sit around and figure out what to do. They drafted a plan.

Hoover was the head of the committee. They drafted a plan, which was sent to the President. Most of the work in the plan is by the man who's referred to in your introduction, Mr. Houston, in which they were going back were told the procedures that had been carried on in this country from 1941 to '66. Procedures, which Senator Symington called a license for unlimited burglary.

Nixon called with a new euphemism that will go down in history means a surreptitious entry. The plan apparently was to burglarize all the opponents, and to burglarize embassies that might be giving them money. It's also a plan to intercept the mail, cut off communications, and whatever else was necessary. And I think we've got to find some rather amazing things because both Symington and Ervin have promised to print the plan next week.

We're told what they were doing was a series of activities that have been going on in this country by the FBI from 1941 to '66. That they were stopped in 1966 almost casually, by Ramsey Clark, when he was asked by the FBI if they minded if they burglarize another embassy. And he reports, he told him, it's illegal, unconstitutional, and wrote it all out for them.

And Hoover kept his letter, possibly kept it under his pillow, but had it with him in 1970 when Nixon won and starts this all over again, that Hoover wrote a series of objections to the order. And these objections include the news he got from Ramsey Clark, that it all happens to be illegal. Time magazine indicates that the per line paper of Mr. Dean is Hoover's copy. That it's a copy with annotations by Hoover. And so, all the reasons he's given for why he won't do it.

It went to the President, or at least since nobody talks to the President, we have reason to believe it went to the President, the copyist mark, the President's copy and not either Mr. Haldeman, Ehrlichman, or Mitchell's, or anybody else, but the copy that's in existence is the President's copy. So, it went to him, we don't know whether he read it.

Any rate, he issued the order in spite of all of Hoover's objections, and Hoover just apparently, refused to do anything about it. Five days later, the order was withdrawn, and the president says [Balti 00:24:26] was never implemented. And since it was never implemented, we're then told in a background story in New York Times, the crisis broke out as to what the hell were they going to do if they couldn't carry on their business this way?

And the crisis, as reported by President's present counsel, [Mr. Gourmand 00:24:45], was they were convinced the Arabs in this country are about to do something awful. And one remembers the world of summer in 1970, the number of Arabs in America was not a very large number. But in spite of this, Mr. Gourmand reports they were going to have meetings. Here's the page.

Try and settle a Middle East question. Here we were on the eve of Middle East talks with information that the Arab commandos were going to start killing leaders in the Jewish community in America. What are we going to do? We're helpless. So, what he says, what they did is they asked the Israelis about it.

And the suggestion in the interview is not only ask the Israelis, the Israelis did it, burglarized whatever embassy had to be burglarized, and quieted down their nerves for a moment. But in quieting down their nerves, they then found a state of affairs in which the major intelligence agencies wouldn't accept the paranoid interpretation of the world that was emanating from the White House.

And the White House wasn't going to give up its paranoid interpretation. And so, it's from this that various agencies we just discovered existing came into being, the internal evaluation services, or the intelligence evaluation service, and something else, which McCord stumbled upon, and was getting memos from.

And Jack Anderson has been publishing their memos, which are extremely paranoid about the riot in San Diego, which are talking about half a million people coming to San Diego, they're buying thousands of guns, and making armored tanks. This whole scheme, and the paranoia that's involved in it actually begins with Nixon's arrival on the scene.

First thing Mitchell gets involved in as head of the Justice Department, is a decision in the Supreme Court in 1969, about wiretapping, Supreme Court rules against Mitchell's side. And Mitchell, unlike any other secretary of the Justice Department before him, interferes with the process of the Supreme Court.

And we've learned to send somebody around to try and get the Supreme Court to reconsider the case on the grounds that there was national security that they didn't realize. Supreme Court refused to consider it. So, Mitchell made a decision that it was up to him to decide whether national security warranted wiretapping. And it took from 1969 to 1971 to get the court to decide that Mitchell can't write the laws himself.

They have to be passed by somebody, and there doesn't happen to be a law, which says that the Justice Department has the right to wiretap who it wants. So, for 1969 to '71, we know he was doing it, and was doing it partly because of these leaks from the government. But mainly it appears because of that panic about the Blacks, the students, and the counterculture.

And one element, which I think is going to loom large in this, that one of the things that starts immediately along with Mitchell's desire to wiretap is the repression of the drug culture. And Operation Intercept, which is September 1969 is part of this overall scheme to suppress all the tendencies that Nixon and his friends couldn't stand.

And I think we're going to find that some of what was going on in the background of Operation Gemstone is involved with a drug problem. The story appeared a couple of weeks ago in the Washington Post. But within the first month that Nixon was in office, some leading pharmacologist was called to Washington and told by Egil Krogh, later one of the plumbers.

That if he didn't agree with the White House on what to do about the drug problem, and the pharmacologists from Cornell have the view that one should treat it as a medical problem, and investigate it medically. He was told if he didn't agree at the White House as a police problem, that the White House would destroy him, were Egil Krogh's words to them.

And apparently, they went ahead and tried to destroy the research of anybody who didn't agree with him. Well, it's all these efforts to get control of the opposition that they saw that after the FBI and CIA wouldn't cooperate, then they start creating their own units. And then, we're told that our President went out of his mind, got absolutely furious.

Didn't know what this man, Ellsberg, was likely to do. If he'd do something as terrible as give New York Times those papers. God knows what else he might do. And they immediately had to go find out what sort of a demon they were dealing with. And hence, dispatch of Hunt, Liddy, and the Cubans to Los Angeles, to go get into the psychiatrist.

Apparently, when the FBI asked the psychiatrist was Ellsberg crazy, and he wouldn't discuss the case. That wasn't enough. So, they had to find out more and Hunt's... what's the term they use? They had to find out about his prosecutability. Since they seem to have thought he really was crazy. Anybody who would do something in this order, answers result of Ellsberg that we get the plumbers.

Had no agency, other than the one in the White House is sufficient to deal with this. And from then on, the plumbers are going around burglarizing. And we're gradually finding out more and more burglaries. I think we're up to five, and seems from the scheduling of these things. But Hunt never took a day off. And any day he was in a city, where there's a place worth burglarizing, they did it.

And it's something I'm baffled about it, in terms of your charts, in terms of our general view that Hunt must be the best spy this country had. He always burglarized us with a crowbar. But the job was done in Los Angeles, that was done in the Watergate, that was done in the NAACP headquarters in New York, it was done in the Greenspun safe in Las Vegas, are all done with crowbars, and it just make a mess out of the place.

And there's absolutely no effort to hide the fact that the robbery has gone on. And what's surprising is, given the amount of robbery that occurs, everybody, except for the democrats assumed it was normal robbery, and made nothing out of it. And now, suddenly, everybody is realizing that their robbery was something more significant. And were beginning to get the pattern out of this.

Well, with all this setup, then we start getting the actual Operation Gemstone. I think the actual Operation Gemstone stems from the 1970 campaign, that Mr. Mitchell, who I think we'll find is much more the evil genius of all this than he now appears since the present stage of the argument. It's Mr. Dean leaking a lot of information as to what's wrong with Haldeman and Ehrlichman.

And next stage after we get done with the Dean 1970 paper, then I think we'll get back to what's wrong with Mr. Mitchell. And Mr. Mitchell was Nixon's campaign manager for 1970, in which the Republicans were going to gain control of Congress, and they were going to gain control of Congress by this law-and-order campaign of suppressing the counterculture.

And you may remember, the campaign came to a bad end in San Jose when Nixon appeared in a parade, a riot occurred, somebody or so-called riot, somebody threw a rock at him, took the reporters about an hour to find out it's a paid rock thrower. And the San Jose Riot found to be this one that Don describes, it was going to take place at San Diego, where they'd really have a riot. The last day of the campaign consisted of two speeches, Nixon, raving in Phoenix, on TV, about this riot in San Jose need for law and order and so on.

Then, after him, Mr. Muskie sitting calmly by his seafront in Maine, about how we should be reasonable, consider the problems of this country, and so on. And the contrast between this raving maniac and Muskie then made it appear to the voters, as opposed indicating that Mr. Muskie was going to be the next President of the United States.

At this point, we get what has now been labeled by Charles Taft, the son of Senator Taft, and his report that the fair campaign practices committee that was issued last weekend, a conscious conspiracy to violate laws, to manipulate voters, and to make a mockery of the democratic system of self-government. Mr. Taft's committee has published along report, giving the details as to how they did it.

In which, structured first to make sure Muskie couldn't be a candidate, Senator Kennedy couldn't be a candidate. Muskie were beginning to see was destroyed by these fake letters, by various people sent to break up Muskie meetings, to disarrange his schedule, to antagonize voters. And I think in a month or two, we're going to find thousands of what Don calls contact agents here, who were doing nasty little things, which had the effect of getting rid of all musky strength.

So, it did appear amazing that Muskie began in 1972 as a sure winner in the Democratic Convention, and then couldn't carry the Polish Warden Milwaukee or Philadelphia. So, the job was really thorough. Kennedy never got off the ground as a candidate. And the indication of why he didn't is that in Mr. Hunt's papers that were given to Mr. Gray to guard and later to burn.

One is the fake cables about the late President Kennedy. The other is a file called Chappaquiddick. And nobody has asked Hunt yet, as far as I know, what was in the file about Chappaquiddick. I've asked him about the cable, and he's gone into lovely detail, which I'll mention some things about in the moment.

Also Mr. Caulfield, who you may have enjoyed last week, New York cop looks like he's from a grade B night-night movie, who works on divorce cases and blackmails people. And he calls up the White House from pay phones and things. That's his story that he got called up in a motel in San Clemente. He's told to go out, and put a dime in the booth, and call up the White House.

The Western White House to get his instructions, but Caulfield also says he was working on Chappaquiddick. But nobody, again, asked him what is he working on? So, we know of Caulfield and Hunt gathering enough crap about this, to scare Kennedy away from being a candidate. Muskie got sandbagged Segretti's activities, and other people.

And recently, I heard just yesterday that they've been able to find that both Hunt and Segretti were in San Diego back in February and March of 1972, arranging for people to disrupt Muskie's campaign if he ran the California primary. So, things seem to have been organized fairly far in advance, and got the job done. As the election season went on, it wasn't all roses for Nixon.

The ITT scandal was blowing up. Jack Anderson was publishing very damaging documents. And the plumbers had to make sure that the Democratic Party was as weak as possible. It's in May, the two remarkable events occur. One, that a leading candidate who would have made Nixon's election probably impossible, George Wallace suddenly gets shot, and can't run for public office anymore.

If Wallace hadn't been shot, we'd still be counting the vote, and still be trying to figure out who won the election. That he would have gotten a third of the vote, Nixon would have gotten around a third, and McGovern around a third. So, just fortuitously, the one candidate who really mattered gets knocked off by as usual, one lone nut.

And who gets very quickly tried declared insane, but not so insane, they can't lock them up for life. And is cutoff, and all information about him is cutoff. The other amazing event is the burglarizing and the bugging of the Democratic headquarters. The explanation we've been given this by the two participants who have appeared on TV, McCord and Barker.

McCord explains how he has given all this news about the riot in San Diego, a menace building up to the Republican Party. And his job as security officer for the Republican Party. What else could he do, but try and find out whether it's all real. And McCord was tantalizing the senators by telling him he's getting these daily reports from the intelligence evaluation service.

And nobody asked him why these things say, unfortunately, Jack Anderson is telling us what they say and they're just absolutely screaming about the problems of this riot in San Diego. Barker, I think is more a comedy relief to it. But Barker's testimony indicates that the team that sold on the view must be relevant to national security. And national security somehow must be at what's at issue.

Barker tells us what the information he has given about national security was the Cubans were financing McGovern. They send him $10 to $20 million. So, they break into the headquarters. Barker admits that there isn't the wrong office. So, there's no such data, but since they're written in an office, you might as well do something. So, he starts burglarizing.

And you may remember the marvelous scene when one of the senators asked Barker, if he can really believe that the burglarizing in these Democratic headquarters has something to do with liberating Cuba. And Barker says sometimes I get confused about these matters. But he surely says that if Mr. Hunt was foreign, it must have something to do with national security.

Of national security, which all this is enveloped in from time they get into office is a real issue. If there really is something we're supposed to be worried about, if the country is coming apart, or there are foreign ministers, and so on, why can't it be explained? Why can't they actually state what the problem is, and what has to be done to safeguard the country, and find out if people want the country saved or not?

If they want to save, what price they'll take to save it? Instead of explaining it, this quotation I gave you from Weicker's speech yesterday, that people regard the constitution as a suicide pact, if it really is a suicide pact in this day and age, and it's perfectly possible to document written in 1787, isn't really applicable 1973. Then, some real effort should be made to consider what the state of affairs is, what laws we do need if we're really in danger, what constitutional changes ought to be made.

Instead, nothing like this gets proposed. Instead, we're told the government was helpless, they had to do something to defend national security. So, they do all these illegal things, instead of trying to explain to the Congress, to the populace, that we're really in a bind, and a fix, and we need new laws. A couple of attempts to explain the problem was so preposterous, that didn't convince anybody.

The first attempt to explain the problem was in the case of Mitchell against the New York Times, when New York Times started printing the Pentagon Papers. If you remember, Mitchell rushed in the car to try and get the first injunction in American history against a prior publication. And in court after court, as New York Times was stopped, and the Boston Globe, and the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times and other papers, took on the job for printing the documents.

In court after court, Mitchell tried to explain why it was necessary. And when they finally, a couple of days got it up to the Supreme Court, a Supreme Court doctored by Mr. Nixon with lots of his friends on it, they still got unanimous verdict against them. They couldn't convince anybody. In contrast to this state of affairs, where they're arguing about national security, and can't make reasonable conservative people believe in.

We've just seen a case in England, where two ministers had to be removed because their sex lives. And the Prime Minister of England immediately explained to commons what the problem was. Everybody agrees, unfortunately, it's a problem. They have to solve it right away. And they've appointed an independent commission that everybody trusts, and there's no uproar at all about the problem anymore.

The cases were now being offered, which are enveloped in last week's testimony of national security revolve around the laundering of $100,000 of a Texas oil millionaire's money. It was sent from Houston to Mexico City, to Mr. Stans, to Mr. Barker. And day after day, we're being told that this is the point at which the CIA had to stop the FBI from investigating the Watergate.

And yesterday's testimony of Mr. Ehrlichman, I think really indicates how far gone this case is. The CIA, meeting with Ehrlichman, Gray, and so on, explains that they've nothing whatever to do with the Watergate, they have nothing to do with those $100,000. They don't care who investigates the $100,000. It's not going to interfere with their business.

So, it's either Ehrlichman or Haldeman, who said yesterday, then they asked the CIA, is it possible that in the course of this investigation, that something relating to the CIA might turn up? Can you give us an absolute guarantee that if we investigate this, we won't turn up some CIA operation? I say of course, we can't give you such a guarantee. We got that problem just giving people a parking ticket.

They can't guarantee who's got over parked. Well, it's one of their agents or not. So, on that basis, the FBI is then called off the case, because they might stumble on a CIA agent. What does all this suggest? I think it clearly suggests the national security issue from Nixon 1969 to Nixon 1973 is bogus, but not just as bogus for the last four years. But I think we now have to consider maybe it's bogus for the last 25 years.

Ever since I started all this, that maybe last time I was talking, discussing the possibility goes from Dallas to the Watergate, but maybe it goes from the pumpkin papers to the Watergate. And may have noticed that during the debacle at the end of the Pentagon Papers case here. That some of the testimony of Hunt was given to the court in Los Angeles, some of his grand jury testimony.

In that grand jury testimony, Hunt explained how he made the fake cable, the fake cables that Kennedy is supposed to have sent ordering the assassination of him in 1963. And Hunt said, when he said to work on the cables, he couldn't find the typewriter in which the cables were originally written. But he said, since the Alger Hiss case, nobody takes typewriter evidence seriously.

So, it didn't matter, and then proceeded without the real typewriter to make his forgeries. I noticed a couple of days ago, Nixon said that one reason he couldn't trust the CIA's answer, they had nothing to do with the Watergate, is that you can't rely on your subordinates. But that's what Truman did in his case. So, Nixon has his case on his mind all the time, as to where this all starts.

In his case, there are plenty of indications as false data. In his second trial, experts from the Fogg Museum in Boston went over the typewriter evidence, issued a report saying that the typewriter alleged to be Alger Hiss' typewriter is a handmade typewriter, in which the fonts was soldered by hand. And it's a sort of typewriter you couldn't buy, that it isn't Mr. Hiss' typewriter, that the documents presented in his trial were not typed in the order that they're chronologically dated.

And one expert said documents were not from 1938 or from 1948. All this appears in the appendix in Alger Hiss' book on the case. At the time, the Court refused to reopen the case on the basis of this evidence. I think after what Hunt said, and Hunt also casually remarks in the grand jury testimony, when he was asked to fabricate the cables was no great difficulty for him, because he'd been trained to do this. And he'd done it successfully many times.

And I hope when he appears before the urban committee, somebody starts asking him that these many times. But if this forgery has been going on by the government, how do we know it didn't start with the pumpkin papers? At the whole demolishment of a liberal state department, the whole construction of the Cold War isn't the outgrowth of this thing.

This was followed in rapid fire succession by the Rosenberg case, by McCarthyism completely eliminating a whole liberal past that grown up under Franklin Roosevelt. Then, in the '60s, we find a whole series of political assassinations, which have changed the whole nature of our country. Each one of these assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and the attempted assassination of Wallace were immediately covered up.

Strangers documents are classified top secret like Oswald's 1962 tax return, like the autopsy of Robert Kennedy. All this is being hidden, claimed to be classified, claimed to be classified in the interest of national security. Now, that we know what national security amounts to under Nixon, and we've been told that the FBI was doing the sort of things Nixon wanted to reinstitute in 1970 was doing these from 1941 to '66.

I think it's time to get extremely suspicious, and to demand that we find out what's really been going on in this country, and who's actually been running it. Come to the end of the story for the time being, what are we going to do at the present state of affairs? I think present state of affairs, I was in Washington a couple of weeks ago, has reached crisis proportions.

The Nixon's government is a shambles, is unable to function anymore, that he is crippled as a president, and won't be trusted by his party, or by Congress for the rest of his term. When the 1970 paper purloined by Dean is published in a week or so, [inaudible 00:50:34] show that he ordered the commission of felonies, the violation of laws, violation of constitution, the violation of his oath of office.

What's going to follow then? Nixon, I think, gave his last defense in this crazy 4,000-word statement. And has nothing left to do. The Independent prosecutor Mr. Cox, first day in the job, gets informed, he's not an independent prosecutor. He's now supposed to take orders from Nixon. Nixon can't even remember from day-to-day, what the state of affairs is.

Congress is faced with an extremely serious problem if the government can function, and they're going to have undoubted proof the President has committed crimes. Agnew at the moment is functioning as impeachment insurance. He used to function as assassination insurance. Because no one lone nut... at least the suspicion is, there's no nut long enough, who prefers Agnew as President, to the present state of affairs.

And now, Congress, I think is feels somewhat stymied that if they impeach, the result is fairly obvious. And Nixon said to the... POW said to his family, he's not going to quit. And nobody's taken up Congressman Royce's plan that Nixon and Agnew both quietly resign, and we proceed from there. This being the state of affairs, I'm starting a suit to an all the election on the grounds of fraud, deceit, and so on.

And I think the report by Charles Taft is adequate grounds. And this is no joke. The suit is being discussed now in Massachusetts, New York, Missouri, Nevada, and California. And [inaudible 00:52:27] in the San Diego is preparing a suit for me, and others preparing in other states. And I think that this is our best way out. We know that the last election was a fake.

We know we didn't have a genuine democratic election. And now is the time, instead of moving forward into the impeachment problem, moving backward to halt a genuine election, and then start getting down to our problems. And the question is whether we have any faith that the... I assume you're talking about the Ervin committee. Well, the Ervin committee is really going to unearth all this, and speaker doesn't have much faith in the Democratic Party, thinks they're unlikely to really get to the bottom of it.

My guess is the bottom may be extremely deep. And Mr. Dean said in an interview in Time magazine last week, they've moved a couple of inches, but they have several miles to go. And I think he knows where off he speaks. But I think it's also seeing a real crisis in the establishment that they never realized that the mafia politics had taken over.

And what they assumed was a game that they play between the Democratic and Republican Party, according to certain rules, has been burst wide open by Nixon, and his crew, and Nixon's crew has thrown as made the Democratic Party, the enemy, and the Republican establishment unwanted. So, if the Republican establishment can talk to Nixon, there's an article, San Diego paper yesterday, then Bob Wilson, the head of the Congressional Committee of the Republicans, can't get ahold of Nixon on the phone.

Hasn't been able to for months, because Haldeman hates him. So, I think the establishment wants to get rid of a feature of this. At the same time, they're so astounded by what's being used here, that at least some members of it I talked to in the last couple of weeks, are prepared for the first time in a decade to consider that something outrageous has been going on for a hell of a long time.

And that if this conspiracy can be run in the last couple of years out of the White House, that may be something like it has been running for the last decade. So, I think people who would never have entertained the possibility that a conspiracy of the sort that appears in executive action could actually be taking place in this country. Now, can see it's perfectly plausible set of events because the same damn things has happened the last couple of years. So, I think there will be pressure to get much further than they have in the past.

**Donald Freed** I just like to say a word to that. You know it's traditional in the American political scene that when there is extremism on the right, it is conservative forces, which have dismantled it. That was true after the Palmer Raids. It was true in the McCarthy period, when Joseph Welch, the acerbic Republican from Boston, and the Watkins committee, took apart the McCarthy power base and brought censorship to the Congress.

And as now, it's Judge Sirica, and the conservative constitutionalist, Senator Ervin. That's been the history in this country that the swing away from right extremism has come from the center in this country and never from the left. And I think that that's what we have to face now. And when we look forward now, perhaps to teachings on the campuses, the way that were on the war.

And in churches, and in labor unions, and townhall meetings, that there be, for the first time in American history, a radical critique, and plan of action come forward out of this, and that we're not simply rest, as the gentleman suggests in the benign expectations of the Democratic Party to do the work for us. We have to not just be spectators at this television spectacular, but take a lucid, and audacious series of actions of which an overflow meeting like tonight is a good example.

The ties to Dallas at this point, I think are basically structural, that is organized crime, a certain kind of industry er, especially aerospace, and conglomerate industry, and intelligence fronts, those ties exist. This is the paradigm or the model that we see here for Dallas. As far as actual personnel, that's tied between Gemstone, and the executive action of Dallas in 1963.

Of course, that's very difficult, and it's going to take a lucky break really to break through. But let us say that one of those arrested in the Watergate, a man named Frank Sturgis, a professional assassin was a friend, a colleague, a co-worker of both Lee Harvey Oswald and David Fairey, who was Lee Harvey Oswald's New Orleans control, or agent handler, and who had been working with him since he had been a teenager, as a matter of fact.

And Sturgis was questioned by the FBI immediately after the Dallas assassination. It was left ambiguous as are most things in the Warren report. But he does seem to be a link, and he is involved in executive actions outside of the country. That much, we know for sure.

**Richard Popkin** What evidence is there linking Sturgis? Sturgis was arrested the day after... he was interrogated the day after on November 23rd. There now are something like 60 pages of interviews with Sturgis from the FBI that are available, which don't hang together with what else we know. Sturgis apparently new Oswald in 1962 in Miami, has no evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who was killed in Dallas, ever was in Miami.

So, Sturgis may have known somebody else using that name. And in my book, I offer evidences, at least one other character, and I think by now, we know of two other people who use that name. So, Sturgis may have known somebody else using that name in some of these operations. Sturgis was involved in executive actions, was partly in Barker's speech on behalf of Sturgis the other day on the TV, and what a great man he was. He started rattling off his past activities.

But I think when start just testifies, we're going to find that he has been engaged in a lot of CIA activities trying to change the governments in Latin-American countries. The question is why are some of the witnesses now speaking, because they have immunity. Nothing more can happen to them, and they hope in case of McCarthy hasn't been sentenced yet. I was hoping to influence the sentence.

In case of others, the sentence can be reduced. Now, Hunt and Sturgis have enormous sentences at the moment. But they've been given immunity for any other crime they want to discuss. So, I understand Hunt and Sturgis have been telling me grand jury tons of things of what else they did for a living. They can't be prosecuted for any other crime. So, I think it's suppressing pressure that a lot of these people are not interested in spending the rest of their life in jail.

**Donald Freed** And I think besides that, we see here what's called, clearly, a contradiction in the ruling circle. The CIA is fighting for its life, as is the FBI. And it's clear that McCord and others that are going to go down the line to protect the CIA, and the only way they can protect the CIA is to implicate fatally the White House.

So, that if this were happening in another country, where you saw the attempted takeover of intelligence agencies, and then an open rebellion, between, and among the intelligence agencies, and the executive, you would realize that you were dealing with an aborted coup, and with a government enmeshed in the hysteria, and stranglehold of an aborted coup.

**Richard Popkin** And may be taken in by a political way in which this thing is developing, that if the democrats start screaming, then they build up an opposition in the republican party that would hamstring it. And I think I'm not privy to what the Democratic Party's councils are. But it appears to me that they are playing a very careful game of letting the conservative Democrats and the Republicans blow the thing wide open, and not doing any pushing their own. They don't have to.

But I think another one of your points is very serious as to whether as this unfolds and becomes obvious, the Democrats are peripheral targets. And the real paranoia of the government was about the counterculture. Whether the Democrats are going to care that much about the controls who have introduced for the counterculture, and going to let the thing peter out when it gets to that point.

But I think the horror of they've all everybody has read the purloined document, as expressed, indicates, that does go beyond anything they'd ever conceive of doing.

**Donald Freed** I think that these points are well taken. And it is a fight within a fight. That is to say, the Rockefeller agent, Haig is in the White House now, the moderate wing of the Republican Party, while the right wing of the Republican Party is moving swiftly to take over the funding, and the state, and city machinery of the GOP machine. So, there's a terrific fight going on.

I would guess that we could say power has already changed hands, in my opinion. The fact that the independent prosecutor could only be a Kennedy man is a clear indication to me that the Kennedy elements of the establishment, of the ruling circle are definitely coming into power at that level.

That isn't to say the popular level, but at the level of the machinery of government, and the backing of those elements in the establishment, which couldn't be considered progressive as opposed to the more reactionary elements that lie behind Operation Gemstone.

I do think that in the teach ends that I contemplate coming up that it's time for a revision, and demystification of the Cold War, and the '50s has never before, and that the Hiss case and the Rosenberg case have to be shown now. We can now point, we've been able to point all along to forgeries, and subornation, and every other kind of blackmail used in those cases.

Now, we have a different kind of context, a different kind of spotlight, and we owe it to the 1950s. They perpetrated war on the progressive movements in this country. They use the techniques of war while we use the techniques of the First Amendment. We used leaflets. We used the right to free speech, the right to demonstrate peacefully, we used the electoral process, we used political process to try to make change.

It's clear now that we suffered, and underwent a series of warlike actions against us. That explains our defeats in the '50s. It explains what happened to the Black Liberation movement in the '60s, they were the victims of warlike acts. That explains our defeats, not some subjective, and psychological, and hypercritical technique that we've developed to blame each other for our defeats.

We suffered at the hands of a paramilitary orchestrated operation that's been in high gear for some 25 years. Having seen that, we have to come back now with the political techniques that we have developed in these periods, and do what we did for Watergate, what we did in the war. We were able to create in the anti-war movement, so much contradiction, that operation Watergate became inevitable for the ruling circle. And that's our next challenge in the '70s now.

**Richard Popkin** I think one of the great opportunities we're going to have, whether we do it, or whether the establishment does it, is for the first time, we're going to find out how they carried on this paramilitary war, that people are now coming up from the underground, the FBI, the Secret Service, and so on. And the CIA are willing to explain how certain events occurred. And for the first time, we'll get the data, and then be able to construct a real history of what went on.

Question was whether, and lieu of what's come out about the difficulties the present administration has with J. Edgar Hoover, and the opportune time of his death, whether there's any reason to suspect, I don't know whether you're suggesting foul play. I just don't know of any reason he was an elderly gentleman, not in good health. So, what was he, 76? So, I don't find it extraordinary.

But it is the month of May 1972 does turn out to have been a very extraordinary month. Hoover died at the beginning of it. Bremer has shot Wallace in the middle of it, and the Watergate occurred. And isn't it also the month of one of the great busts in Washington DC around?

**Speaker 4** (singing).

**Host** Twelve minutes, but not before we got a couple of more subscriptions at 848-6-

**Speaker 4** (singing).

**Donald Freed** ... proof of two guns firing at the Ambassador Hotel in 1968. But this question, I try to take up in detail in the novel of fact, executive action. One of the reasons the left did not respond to a crisis in 1963, certainly the equivalent of Watergate in 1973, was that the scenario, the cover up scenario worked, but the question is well taken. And in these teach ends, I think the left should examine why it is that it accepted these crucial assassinations.

Accepted the story put out by the government propaganda, and did not address itself to these issues, which affected the man in the street, and the woman in the street in the '60s in the way that the war affected the radicals. I'll take this occasion now to make a revelation for the first time in public concerning the Kennedy assassination.

And that is that both Professor Popkin and I on separate occasions, well, I'll speak only for myself, have now had confirmed that Mr. Clay Shaw was not a contract agent, but an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency. And that comes from the highest-ranking Central Intelligence Agency officer ever to quit, Victor Marchetti. The super conspirator Charles Colson is the goal between the Teamsters and the White House.

**Richard Popkin** And he's a Teamsters lawyer right now.

**Donald Freed** Yeah. He's also the Teamsters lawyer. He took that account with him when he left the White House early, after having covered his tracks as he thought perfectly to set up Ehrlichman, Haldeman, Mitchell, and Dean, and not get caught himself. And it's dubious to me whether Colson, who to me is the arch conspirator ever will be caught.

And the reason I call Colson a double agent is that Colson does not come to the White House from the USC old boy gang, or from UCLA, or from the West Coast. Colson comes from being the chief aide to Carl McIntire, the man in charge for orchestrating the pro war marches, and the link between McIntire and the American mission in Saigon and martial key.

And when he left the right, and these are the extreme elements of the right, the American Security Council. These are the elements involved, the action elements in these assassinations. When he went to the White House, the euphemism was used that he was to be liaison for the committee to reelect that is said to ethnic groups, the American Legion, and so forth.

What he was liaison to was the extreme right, those same men from the American Security Council, and the National Rifle Association, et cetera, who alone met with Nixon on the eve of the invasion of Cambodia.

**Richard Popkin** Let me add. The Teamsters are special problem that they've been involved with Nixon for a long time, they paid for his house and [inaudible 01:09:59] estate. And I'm sorry, Peter Scott isn't here tonight because he's an expert on all the dealing is with him. A big suit is now going on between Shatner, and the man from New Hampshire, a leader, a lobe of her, Shatner's role in collecting $2.5 million to $3 million to get her half out of jail, and the Teamsters' contribution to the reelection fund.

So, I think the Teamsters are a special element in their relations with Nixon. But with regard to Colson, besides what Don says, I had noticed that Colson is the one who brought Hunt into the whole operation we've been looking for, how he happened to know Hunt, and Hunt isn't the sort of man you meet casually. He's always off on a job. It turns out Colson went to college with Hunt in Brown in 1942.

And they've been friends ever since. Hunt is also the extreme right. And I met somebody who had been with Hunt the day Nixon went to China, and Hunt was raising, we shouldn't send people to China, we should send bombs to China. And here is Nixon's best agent, best burglar, and he doesn't even support the China policy.

**Donald Freed** By the way, both Colson and Hunt were two of the original organizers of Young Americans for Freedom, a definite intelligence front, and that Young Americans for Freedom will start to figure prominently now, I think, as we go further into Operation Gemstone, along with Viva.

**Richard Popkin** The only other person who surfaces, a friend of Hunt's is William Buckley. And Buckley is the godfather of Hunt's for children, and the executor of Mrs. Hunt's estate.

**Donald Freed** In the novel executive action exists what I consider the proof that Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs fiasco came to the decision, that capital, and the establishment could only be saved by the dismantling of CIA clandestine, which had gotten out of control, a Cuban desk, and elements in the CIA were out of control, and that he must liquidate the involvement in Vietnam.

Now, you can argue as some do, and there's two arguments, one that it was a steady, smooth escalation from Eisenhower through Nixon, or that Kennedy was making a change. And that was one of the reasons he was assassinated. I think there's proof for the second for this reason. When the headlines in 1963 October, the blazoned troops home by Christmas, advisor's home by 65.

And he put those words in the mouth of McNamara and Taylor. You can argue, well, he was just lying, like Johnson and Nixon. But there's one flaw in that argument. One thing that nobody ever did, except Kennedy was set a date. To set a date was to take away the option for a political realist like the Kennedy brothers of going back on that option.

In other words, he made this over a year before the election. He was bringing 1,000 troops a month home. He was down to 12,000. And Popkin and I sat in the Pentagon Papers trial and our mouth fell open when we heard read from the pentagon papers that the National Security Council minutes of August, September, and October 1963, and November, are missing.

And the historian of the Pentagon Papers in a footnote says therefore, we have to rely on books that were published about the period. And it was precisely that gap, or lacunae of August, September, October, November '63, when the decision was taken to liquidate Vietnam, we only have the quote from Bobby Kennedy. We have to go all away, or get out, the same thing he used on the Hawks in the Bay of Pigs crisis.

And we know with the technique of the Kennedy brothers, they'll force the hand of the hawks, and tell them to go all away, or get out. That's all we have left over from that four-month period. It was into that gap that Charles Colson had Howard Hunt forge the cables, because that gap existed, that those cables had been missing since just after the assassination.

And it's into that gap that the forge cables to tie JFK to the DM assassination went. So, I think that we have proof now that Kennedy, for reasons having nothing to do with pity for the Indo-Chinese people, or a change of heart, decided just as Nixon decided many years later to go to China to do many things. The salt talks, disarmed, many things that Kennedy was planning.

It's simply that Kennedy almost a generation earlier had taken the decision that he would build a new kind of coalition of labor, minorities, young people, and institute a kind of American quasi social democracy, and set up a reign which would lead from John Kennedy, to Robert Kennedy, to Edward Kennedy stretching to 1984, a 24-year reign of power, and an enormous restructuring of America

So, that I'm not minimizing the power potential of the Kennedy brothers. What I'm saying is that I believe all evidence points that when those headlines came out, troops home by Christmas, advisor's out by 65, that it was true.

**Richard Popkin** Let me add a couple of facts I know on this. In the Washington Post of last Saturday, I print a story about the real secret intelligence organization that runs everything, which keeps changing its name, anytime anybody finds out what its name is. And it keeps no records, but they decide what executive actions will take place, and so on.

And the story says that Bobby Kennedy was never allowed to be a member of this group. He wanted very much to be, but Mitchell did become a member. And it got politicized as soon as Mitchell got involved. Kennedy was trying to get in charge of this thing, and was failing all through 1963 have been setting up committees to find out what was really going on, and who was running the intelligence organizations.

And every time, these committees would turn out to have either Allen Dulles on it, or McCone, or somebody else in the CIA, and Kennedy would be no further along than he was before. The last committee he appointed was in the early 19... November 1973. And Allen Dulles was on it, and I came to know useful conclusion by the time of his death.

And I was told by Senator Morris, that Morris in a conversation with Bobby Kennedy right after the assassination was assured that his brother had taken the decision to get out of Vietnam, and was going to meet with Senator Lodge, who was in our console in Saigon two days later in San Francisco. So, it seems to be a basis for the claim that it was really going to happen.

As far as the Bay of Pigs goes, I don't know when it got started. But it's obviously well underway before Kennedy got to be President. Nixon said he knew all about it during the debates that were going on, and didn't care revealing.

**Donald Freed** These are the best. When we say they're the best, Hunt was in charge of plans, the legendary Eduardo, for Playa Giron, for Giron for the Bay of Pigs. And McCord was a super-agent. Dallas dropped him behind the lines in the Soviet Union in the 1950s on the most delicate operations. But what must be pointed out, and I go to some pains to do it in the novel, they made even more egregious errors in the Dallas assassination of 1963.

But the media, and the electorate, and the left were paralyzed, and did not seize upon these errors. And when you say they are just bunglers, they are the best that American technology, and finance can put forward. And to give proof of that, until the day of their arrest, Hunt and McCord both sat on special emergency crisis committees. McCord was the head of a 16-man unit, working out of the Pentagon in charge of the censorship of news, and the roundup of subversives.

And that's a quote in time of emergency. And Hunt, in the '50s and '60s had sat on to emergency planning boards in charge of censorship of news, and roundup subversives in time of emergency. These are the men who would act out, if necessary, the scenario after the Agent Provocateur did their work in San Diego, or Miami had Operation Gemstone not been aborted. But this is the best they can do.

And they were equally clumsy in the Hiss case and in the Rosenberg case. A fool or a child can see what went on in the Rosenberg case. It's fear, and not lack of their mistakes or our intelligence that have paralyzed us. And I think we have to say that just as they failed abominably in Vietnam with their plans, failed in Cuba, have failed all over the world, and will fail all over the world because their worldview is based on an inferior race, an inferior class, starting with the American populace that is doomed to failure.

And that is why they have to resort everywhere, and always to violence as soon as their crackpot scenarios break down. And that's why we have to push them to the wall now. They are moral morons, and operationally, they are often fools and clowns. But what they have behind them is the organized violence of the state, and that we mustn't underestimate, but we mustn't overestimate the mystique of these clandestine crackpots.

**Richard Popkin** I don't know whether it's arrogance, or whether, as some people are suggesting that maybe they were set up to fail. And they were setting themselves up to fail as part of their CIA work and see against the Nixon administration because the whole thing or the actual Watergate seems a really incredible burglary and New York, Los Angeles, all sorts of places are full of much better burglars than that.

**Donald Freed** There is a new book out in France to identify two of the Watergate men as having approached the OAS, that is the right-wing insurgence against de Gaulle goal to kill Kennedy when he visited de Gaulle in 1962, using as a cover and attempted assassination on de Gaulle. And we don't have enough facts on that yet, but to have the Watergate have been, I think we can guess definitely one of them is, but have been identified in France by an OAS agent.

**Richard Popkin** I was in Washington, earlier part of May, that there's a tremendous struggle going on within the old agency, the CIA, between its original faction that set it up between the Young Turks, who have been trying to get out to people they regard as dinosaurs like Hunt and McCord and the politicized people when Nixon is brought in.

The man who has been appointed new head of the CIA, hasn't been approved by Congress yet, was head of the political assassination division, Mr. Colby. And Mr. Colby has said in testimony before Congress, he's responsible for operation Phoenix, that he killed 6,000 political people in Vietnam by assassination, not by B-52. So, that's the sort of person who is the old CIA.

And Colby, in an interview with New York Times said that he regards the CIA as the most important bulwark of democracy, it's more important for the political government, and so on. I talked to McCord when I was in Washington, and I think McCord hold similar views. And these represent the original CIA position. But then, there are people have come up since the original group, who regard themselves more as technicians, and see Hunt, McCord, Colby and so on, as Neanderthals from the original Cold War.

And then, Nixon has been adding into this politicized people who see the CIA as functioning as an arm of the political process of the ruling government. So, I think of a moment as a three-cornered fight going on, as to who's going to control the CIA, and also what role it's going to play in, in the future. And McCord has been issuing endless memorandums, he gathered from the hearings, he writes them six times a day.

And one day as in Washington, he issued a 383-page memorandum. And each one of these things always ends with a plea for restoring the original CIA. So, I think the old boys are trying to get back to where they were at 1950 or so, and with the influence they have. The question that is asked is, who are Sirhan Sirhan, and James Earl Ray, and how they fit into this pattern of conspiracy?

Ray, I think is very interesting case where the evidence that he was guilty is so minimal, the evidence is involved in conspiratorial activity maximal, and nobody... the establishment immediately decided is a lone nut. He is a racist, and that's why he did it. I couldn't find anybody whoever discuss racism with him that he had lived in Los Angeles in a hotel somewhere around here, and nobody in the hotel ever heard him having the slightest interest in politics, race or anything else.

He apparently is a hired gun, a hired hoodlum who was smuggling from the time he escaped from jail to the time he is arrested after King's death. And smuggling it's not an activity and carry on by yourself. So, we have to smuggle... I'm sorry, it's not one of those victimless crimes. It has to be a conspiracy. Mr. Fensterwald, who is McCord's lawyer is also James Earl Ray's lawyer.

And he's taken on the case after everybody else milked Ray of all the money he had, and he apparently had a hell of a lot in the beginning far more than he could ever have gained by any of the activities at the FBI claimed he was engaged. And the FBI said he earned his money bank robbing, but they could never name a bank he robbed.

So, Ray seems to have been somebody who was hired by a conspiratorial apparatus, which from the fact, he is engaged in smuggling, I guess it's connected with the mafia, and was sent from place to place to do various things. And Ray's own claim is he didn't do the shooting. He was just sent to register in a motel there, register in this rooming house, deliver a gun.

Then, for the first time, since he never read anything, but the sports section, he discovered when the gun went off that Martin Luther King was there and beat the hell out of town. And then, spent a fortune traveling around until he was caught. So, I think Ray is part of a conspiratorial apparatus, and how it's connected with the others, I don't think we know yet.

Sirhan is more mysterious. Maybe Mr. Kimbro knows more about this, but there's certainly plenty of evidence of Sirhan did not act alone. That three people went with him to buy the bullets. There was a lady in a polka dot dress. There's some evidence that he was in San Diego with a man the day before getting ready for the event. So, I think he's hardly a loner.

Fensterwald was found when he tried to get information from the State Department as to whether Sirhan ever had a passport. They clam up entirely, regarded as one of the greatest state secrets of all time. And Fensterwald used to be a lawyer for the State Department. He's been able to find out about anybody else's interested in. if they ever had a passport.

But this is the one case where it's been absolutely stymied. So, I think there is some indication Sirhan is also part of some sort of conspiratorial operators. I have with me a motion that Fensterwald has made in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, a memorandum of facts about the Ray case, which would convince any reasonable man they didn't solve the case.

He's unable to get any evidentiary hearing, just gets turned down these things. So, I'm going to try and publish this as an article. So, at least, if the courts don't want to hear it, people will know that there really is no case against Mr. Ray.
