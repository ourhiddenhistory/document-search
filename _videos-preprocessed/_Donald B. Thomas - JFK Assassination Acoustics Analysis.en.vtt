00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:16.630 align:start position:0%
that requires a diabolical coincidence
 

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
that requires a diabolical coincidence
that's<00:15:16.780><c> the</c><00:15:16.930><c> difference</c><00:15:17.200><c> between</c><00:15:17.290><c> a</c><00:15:17.410><c> false</c>

case you to say that's a false positive
 

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:27.260 align:start position:0%
case you to say that's a false positive
