00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
not so he just declassified thousands of pages of his secret documents from

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.170
 the 1970s that refer to events that occurred in the 1960s by that

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.400
 time was in the central intelligence agency as an officer of that

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.109
 North American body philip there for felip who represents this

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.519
 declassification of cia documents because they are called the jewels of the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.520
 good family you know that during the 70s there was a series

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.210
 break scandals around the city and its operations and a director

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:46.070
 James Schlesinger ordered in May 1973 that each section or division of the chair

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.790
 prepare documents on possible acts that were carried out outside the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:01.339
 letter from the cia that is to say the law of 1947 that established the cia and determined that

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.920
 can do that the agency cannot do one of the things that are prohibited

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.590
 They are operations within the US, that is, any function for example

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.510
 in the part what what

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.180
 complies with the law, that is, the prosecution of criminal acts and they

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.910
 They cannot have any police power in the US they carry other documents

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.790
 reveal that they were involved in antiwar movements in

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.600
 the us if they raped and clearly their

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.860
 letters but they did so at the insistence of the president of the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.720
 day began with johnson around the year 6867 when johnson was determined to

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.020
 find the foreign hand in the whole anti-war protest movement

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.650
 he was convinced that google address funding

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.619
 from outside the country such as on the street or through some other country such as

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.710
 for example behind this moment protest movement and he ordered the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.859
 I have to investigate looking for this hand

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.239
 foreigner and was never found because there was none but anyway

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.609
 that led to the chair violating his letter that is, violating the law with

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:38.800
 domestic activities and in 1963 he made or commanded

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.070
 compile or produce this document with each possible case of activities

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.780
 illegal or outside the letter of the cia you were when that official

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.260
 of the intelligence agent in the 1960s and was also closely related to

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.430
 in a certain way with Latin America than what they discover or what they let see

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.170
 These documents are related to what you reported in your book within

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.030
 the company well this documentation starts at 59 and ends at 73 and that

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.890
 covers all the time that I studied in Latin America not all the 12 years that

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.620
 they study the cia but anyway a large part and I recognized so many names

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:29.410
 in this documentation so many activities and I learned a lot that I did not find what

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.400
 that I wanted to find and that is possibly in the many tens

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.720
 years of pages that are totally blank because there are so many

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:51.170
 new 15 in a row I am not against what I am looking for

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.370
 about me because we know of a documentation in quantity of

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.340
 presentation that we get under the law of limiting the information outside

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.500
 These include references to illegal and illegal acts that she follows committed

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.280
 against me in the years when i was in paris

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.160
 maybe london those were years covered by this

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.789
 document because it was around the year 71 62 33 when I am making the

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.340
 first book of mine diary of the cia and I thought that

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.410
 possibly there would be some reference because they were illegal acts that exists

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.560
 of the domination of the cia but I thought later that maybe they did not include because

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.419
 They were not committed within the United States is they can say they were not

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.030
 illegal and although it says that because they had to protect their information, their

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.900
 personal and they knew that I am working on the book that I was going to do

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.780
 revelations don't know exactly what but they followed me through the streets of paris

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.160
 through the streets in madrid to the streets of berlin everywhere

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.650
 because I was traveling a lot and I did everything openly, not the

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.830
 social flight reservations and I remember once they followed me

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.330
 to the hotel in Madrid and today my friends who came to pick me up at the hotel

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.350
 half an hour they took his house to spend the night because

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.910
 and I'm very nervous and I don't know what would happen to the informed viewer

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.110
 Felipe was an agent of the central intelligence agency there, he resigned from the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.370
 cia when she understood the illegal activities in which the

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.670
 company fundamentally against the peoples of Latin America and later

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.810
 wrote that daily book of the chair within the company that took him by

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.260
 also supposed the rejection within the within the cia the persecution and the

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.750
 own persecution of the state government speaks of general schneider se

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.710
 He talks about other attempts by the CIA in Latin America that later link him

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.440
 of all the terrible history that Latin America had with the dictatorships

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.190
 military in the 1970s at that time you were a CIA officer in

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.690
 Latin America 'what were the main actions that the CIA committed

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.670
 for those times in our good continent

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.280
 an officer like me or the many more that there were no

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.190
 did more than run and then finance and lead Chileans

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.450
 in Chile and Brazilians in Brazil they were the agents, we were the

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.930
 official and they are the locals, the Brazilians are the

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.729
 Chileans who actually carry out the actions in the case of

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.969
 from Chile it is perfectly well known that the cia

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:58.919
 organized the service called dina avilés this was a new service

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:04.499
 established by the series after Allende's murder and it was that service

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:12.449
 that he murdered sneijder if I do not remember new hands nobody if it is not in

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:17.909
 Argentine silver and these services were like

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:22.979
 instruments of the city because I worked with services while

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:28.589
 Ecuador as in Uruguay and knew what they did in other countries and this famous

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:34.829
 'operation condor' emanates from those relationships that the chair had with all

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:39.989
 the security services in all that region, that is, I do not know of any

00:07:39.989 --> 00:07:45.030
 country in Latin America of the Caribbean where Garcia did not have

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.860
 to connections and operations with local services because also that

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.210
 They send Luis Posada Carriles to the people from the chair to the dissip in Venezuela.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:59.580
 exactly the 60s and the chair had very close relationships with the

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.010
 discipline in those years were the years of Carlos Andrés Pérez

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:11.120
 I knew even though I was not in a school it was known because every time one knew

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:18.120
 for the white boy I wanted to know something about an Argentine who is in Quito, so I

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.470
 send a cable to the cia station at the embassy in buenos aires and

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:28.410
 You have to say that they can use and they are or not what that if they can do

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:34.440
 a site with the local service or if they have to restrict the research to

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.800
 the archives of the same station is to say always a distinction of what

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.570
 it has to be done with let's say assets

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:51.269
 um and natural local services in all those years

00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:58.260
 that I was there I guess they were 89 you can never a case when I did

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.260
 could not do an investigation or inquiry with a local service

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:10.530
 they were not always of enormous importance to the company but their

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:17.010
 local services almost nothing can be done because police would have to be used

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:23.360
 or military to carry out the acts that were believed

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:28.759
 carry out and since those years in Latin America that was what helped

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:33.680
 transform the vision of felipe iv on the work of the chair well that

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.629
 came later really because I got out of the chair without tiring to take any

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:44.240
 action write things like that and today you will forget all that

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:53.779
 little by little the idea came to me to make regulations and I also had

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:57.709
 unfaithful influenced by studies I did in the

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:03.260
 unam in Mexico because when I left the CIA I was in Mexico and I wanted to go to

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:10.250
 going back to studying a doctoral program in Latin American accents and reading

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:16.070
 all those horrors of the conquest of the colony knowing that what we do

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:23.120
 us is just a continuation of all nearly 500 years of repression

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:32.630
 genocide policy and things then the idea before unthinkable but I started

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:38.420
 to think of a research book in Mexico to stop

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.550
 look for information to see if the documentation centers and not

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:49.580
 because he can't remind you of all those 8-year-old details I had to look for

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:55.529
 sources and what is some book of mine was that

00:10:55.529 --> 00:11:04.740
 a person in paris told me about the british museum of newspaper archives and i went

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.629
 there and they had all the local newspapers of all the countries of the

00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:15.079
 times when I was there so I can read the newspapers daily

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:23.249
 even weekends in all the cities of countries where I was from

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:29.550
 moment that I was and everything we do the importance came out in the newspapers of

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.220
 so I spent a year reading a microfilm

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:41.639
 and taking notes and dictating at night at home because I have my reader in a box

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:47.220
 he had given me secretarial support so at the end of all that year he had like

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:53.069
 five thousand sheets and had to organize them by it was very difficult because some

00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:58.650
 prayers were active now not now but then start over and

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.840
 so i would select the form of a diary but

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.000
 stating at the beginning that it is not a diary written on the fly but

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.730
 after after sight an impact a tremendous impact on this

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.680
 moment is as long as the chair knew that I am writing a book and they took

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.350
 several measures that I still do not know exactly I do not know its scope good

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.020
 Maybe in 30 years, Felipe will find out through some document

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.010
 declassified what happened to you around that time how we are

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.630
 now finding out terribly what happened against peoples like Cuba like the

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.990
 people of Chile and other Latin American peoples through these

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:45.480
 declassified documents of that would have to continue talking a lot but time

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.770
 is relentless and that is that I do not think that one can

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:56.310
 do it today so a former officer who they knew was

00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:00.240
 taking the path that I took but I was the first and they didn't really know what

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.050
 do well then today I think they would take action

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.490
 very fast if it were today i would eliminate it good with anything possible

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:13.080
 happy there this story of the cia revealed now confirmed with the jewels

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.700
 of the family and that in a few years we will know of many others that occurred

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.720
 at that stage it differs greatly from the central agency that from now on

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.720
 from outside the company that he now sees as a good specialist there are two

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.220
 countries that have me quite worried, one is Venezuela and the other is

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:38.750
 Bolivia and perhaps very soon Ecuador on the spot of the elections

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.950
 electoral processes in the mind in America has been very unfavorable

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:50.180
 by the us and they also have to take action they need these regions and

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:56.240
 control over this region and I am following as closely as possible for me

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:02.450
 what is happening in venezuela regarding the bolivarian government the same

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:09.800
 in Bolivia and I am looking for signs of activity and there are quite a few

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:16.450
 that the chairs are still the secret arm or the furtive arm of the

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:22.720
 U.S. government for and to carry out the government's secret policy because

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.800
 this secret policy violates all conventions all

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.240
 treated all international standards of conduct because

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.530
 includes such things as murders could the cia might be unaware of a fact

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:43.250
 as notorious as we have been in 2000 2002 against the president fight

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:50.630
 I think so of course I don't have that, you have organized very well and I know

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:55.130
 controlled all that but for a new government a new power that they have

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:00.200
 old services well entered by the follow in the past and arrive a present

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.930
 Chávez to power he has to worry about the penetration of his own

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:10.820
 services once the same is present in bolivia right now the same

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:17.180
 business I have the old woman and I know we had the security forces

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:24.590
 totally flooded and we manipulate constantly cost those services in a way

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:30.500
 that although the electoral process is very positive, it must be taken into account

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:36.920
 also the necessary measures to erase all that from the past

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:45.290
 you can't undo a service overnight so it's very difficult

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.790
 know who are the agents that provide these services

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.079
 President Chávez has reiterated the complaint about the dangers of an attack

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:57.399
 against his life exemplary that continue to be developed if they come to provoke

00:15:57.399 --> 00:16:03.410
 demonstrations and social violence venezuela yes very well said and they

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:09.440
 They have to be as worried about all this as Cubans in the years

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.560
 60 so far things are going well but I

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.530
 I care a lot about his life, Chávez and Evo Morales and perhaps

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.870
 run too because she's normal they can't cross their glasses and do anything

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:31.600
 they have to try to subvert this process is very serious philip that that

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.310
 representatives of the southern command have traveled to Latin America more times

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.970
 and the representatives of the intelligence agencies and in the

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.050
 representatives of North American diplomacy I suppose it would be a

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.380
 surprise that command are also quite dangerous

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:54.600
 but the most dangerous day after day that is

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.130
 daily are the solutions of the chairs in each embassy and in various

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:04.829
 consulates too and they can increase their forces invest in Chile or

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:10.799
 in Peru in Bolivia at any time by sending more people to the embassies and

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:16.049
 expanding its operations is an agency and quite flexible and they

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:20.900
 they have staff they have people who speak Spanish they have people who can

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:27.209
 communicate that is to say communicate with an accent or with the leadership so the

00:17:27.209 --> 00:17:33.049
 chair has to be the main arm for the subversion of

00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:39.250
 progressive movements in the region in all Latin American countries

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.730
 working the company continues working and plans are also being developed

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:48.049
 against the peoples and progressive movements of Latin America and the

00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:51.980
 world that is a lesson that these documents also leave us

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.179
 declassified we are not talking about past history we are talking about a

00:17:56.179 --> 00:18:00.500
 present in which there are many of those elements that you see in those dirty

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.130
 jewels of the cia and there are many others that were not revealed by the documents

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.690
 because they also involve people who are in government today or would involve

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.590
 also at that stage in which the central intelligence agency was directed

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:17.419
 nothing more and nothing less than the father of the current president of the United States are

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:21.500
 many things that remain to be revealed we will have to wait perhaps 30 more years 25

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.519
 more years to know many of the things that Empty did against our peoples

00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:29.419
 especially in those saddest moments for Latin America during the

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:32.919
 military dictatorships of the years
