00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
think if you check it it might be 82
 

00:56:30.119 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
think if you check it it might be 82
percent<00:56:30.540><c> of</c><00:56:30.720><c> those</c><00:56:30.960><c> with</c><00:56:31.320><c> an</c><00:56:31.440><c> opinion</c><00:56:31.920><c> yeah</c>

00:56:32.369 --> 00:56:36.020 align:start position:0%

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:36.030 align:start position:0%
and there there are about 15 percent who
 

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:38.150 align:start position:0%
and there there are about 15 percent who
strangely<00:56:36.599><c> enough</c><00:56:36.990><c> have</c><00:56:37.230><c> no</c><00:56:37.500><c> opinion</c><00:56:37.950><c> on</c><00:56:38.040><c> the</c>

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
strangely enough have no opinion on the

strangely enough have no opinion on the
