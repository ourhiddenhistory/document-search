and<00:27:59.840><c> there</c><00:28:00.000><c> was</c><00:28:00.240><c> another</c><00:28:00.559><c> person</c><00:28:01.200><c> sharing</c><00:28:01.520><c> the</c>

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
and it was confusing intentionally
 

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.149 align:start position:0%
and it was confusing intentionally
that's<00:28:06.080><c> one</c><00:28:06.240><c> reason</c><00:28:06.480><c> they</c><00:28:06.640><c> do</c><00:28:06.799><c> that</c>

00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's one reason they do that
 

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:10.789 align:start position:0%
that's one reason they do that
so<00:28:08.320><c> people</c><00:28:08.559><c> can</c><00:28:08.720><c> be</c><00:28:08.960><c> seen</c><00:28:09.200><c> at</c><00:28:09.279><c> the</c><00:28:09.440><c> same</c><00:28:09.760><c> place</c>

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
so people can be seen at the same place
 

00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:11.669 align:start position:0%
so people can be seen at the same place
or<00:28:11.039><c> at</c>

00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
or at
 

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:14.630 align:start position:0%
or at

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
different places at the same time etc so
 

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.029 align:start position:0%
different places at the same time etc so
the<00:28:14.799><c> two</c><00:28:14.960><c> of</c><00:28:15.120><c> them</c><00:28:15.360><c> apparently</c><00:28:15.919><c> had</c>

00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
the two of them apparently had
 

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:20.230 align:start position:0%
the two of them apparently had

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
converged in the theater and uh
 

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.990 align:start position:0%
converged in the theater and uh
both<00:28:20.480><c> were</c><00:28:20.720><c> arrested</c><00:28:21.200><c> and</c><00:28:21.279><c> the</c><00:28:21.440><c> other</c><00:28:21.600><c> guy</c><00:28:21.760><c> was</c>

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
both were arrested and the other guy was
 

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.669 align:start position:0%
both were arrested and the other guy was
arrested<00:28:22.480><c> and</c><00:28:22.559><c> let</c><00:28:22.799><c> go</c><00:28:23.039><c> apparently</c><00:28:23.520><c> in</c><00:28:23.600><c> the</c>

00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:25.590 align:start position:0%
arrested and let go apparently in the

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
back
 

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.669 align:start position:0%
back
so<00:28:26.000><c> that's</c><00:28:26.240><c> one</c><00:28:26.480><c> reason</c><00:28:26.880><c> why</c><00:28:27.120><c> tibbett</c><00:28:27.440><c> might</c>

00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
so that's one reason why tibbett might
 

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.029 align:start position:0%
so that's one reason why tibbett might
have<00:28:27.760><c> been</c><00:28:27.919><c> killed</c>

00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
have been killed
 

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:32.310 align:start position:0%
have been killed
but<00:28:29.440><c> um</c><00:28:29.840><c> he</c><00:28:30.080><c> may</c><00:28:30.240><c> have</c><00:28:30.320><c> been</c><00:28:30.640><c> involved</c><00:28:31.679><c> in</c>

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
but um he may have been involved in
 

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.389 align:start position:0%
but um he may have been involved in
in<00:28:32.480><c> more</c><00:28:32.799><c> depth</c><00:28:33.200><c> in</c><00:28:33.360><c> the</c><00:28:33.679><c> plot</c><00:28:33.919><c> to</c><00:28:34.080><c> kill</c>

00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
in more depth in the plot to kill
 

00:28:34.399 --> 00:28:35.990 align:start position:0%
in more depth in the plot to kill
kennedy<00:28:34.799><c> too</c><00:28:35.039><c> and</c><00:28:35.120><c> i</c><00:28:35.360><c> explore</c><00:28:35.760><c> that</c>

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
kennedy too and i explore that
 

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.870 align:start position:0%
kennedy too and i explore that
possibility<00:28:36.640><c> although</c><00:28:36.960><c> it's</c><00:28:37.120><c> inconclusive</c>

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
possibility although it's inconclusive
 

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.110 align:start position:0%
possibility although it's inconclusive
so<00:28:39.360><c> um</c><00:28:40.720><c> uh</c><00:28:41.200><c> you</c><00:28:41.279><c> know</c><00:28:41.440><c> there's</c><00:28:41.679><c> a</c><00:28:42.159><c> lot</c><00:28:42.399><c> going</c><00:28:42.640><c> on</c>

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
so um uh you know there's a lot going on
 

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.909 align:start position:0%
so um uh you know there's a lot going on

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
with that day her story
 

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.230 align:start position:0%
with that day her story
a<00:44:00.960><c> lot</c><00:44:01.119><c> of</c><00:44:01.280><c> elements</c><00:44:01.599><c> of</c><00:44:01.760><c> her</c><00:44:01.920><c> story</c><00:44:02.079><c> don't</c>

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of elements of her story don't
 

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.910 align:start position:0%
a lot of elements of her story don't
make<00:44:02.480><c> any</c><00:44:02.640><c> sense</c><00:44:02.960><c> at</c><00:44:03.119><c> all</c>

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
make any sense at all
 

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.829 align:start position:0%
make any sense at all
so<00:44:04.400><c> um</c><00:44:04.800><c> it's</c><00:44:04.960><c> still</c><00:44:05.200><c> kind</c><00:44:05.359><c> of</c><00:44:05.440><c> an</c><00:44:05.599><c> open</c>

00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
so um it's still kind of an open
 

00:44:05.839 --> 00:44:07.349 align:start position:0%
so um it's still kind of an open
question<00:44:06.160><c> to</c><00:44:06.319><c> me</c><00:44:06.560><c> whether</c>

00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
question to me whether
 

00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:08.870 align:start position:0%
question to me whether
tibbett<00:44:07.680><c> really</c><00:44:07.920><c> was</c><00:44:08.160><c> home</c><00:44:08.319><c> for</c><00:44:08.480><c> lunch</c><00:44:08.800><c> or</c>

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
tibbett really was home for lunch or
 

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.309 align:start position:0%
tibbett really was home for lunch or
whether<00:44:09.200><c> his</c><00:44:09.359><c> wife</c><00:44:09.599><c> was</c><00:44:09.760><c> giving</c><00:44:10.000><c> him</c><00:44:10.240><c> a</c>

00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
whether his wife was giving him a
 

00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:11.829 align:start position:0%
whether his wife was giving him a
convenient<00:44:10.880><c> alibi</c>

00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
convenient alibi
 

00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:13.910 align:start position:0%
convenient alibi
so<00:44:12.079><c> i</c><00:44:12.160><c> think</c><00:44:12.400><c> the</c><00:44:12.720><c> the</c><00:44:12.880><c> available</c><00:44:13.440><c> evidence</c>

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i think the the available evidence
 

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.829 align:start position:0%
so i think the the available evidence
shows<00:44:14.720><c> that</c>

00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
shows that
 

00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:19.510 align:start position:0%
shows that
he<00:44:16.079><c> was</c><00:44:17.920><c> part</c><00:44:18.079><c> of</c><00:44:18.240><c> the</c><00:44:18.319><c> operation</c>

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
he was part of the operation
 

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.430 align:start position:0%
he was part of the operation
soon<00:44:19.839><c> after</c><00:44:20.160><c> the</c><00:44:20.319><c> shooting</c><00:44:20.720><c> they</c><00:44:20.960><c> wanted</c><00:44:21.280><c> to</c>

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
soon after the shooting they wanted to
 

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.109 align:start position:0%
soon after the shooting they wanted to
eliminate<00:44:21.920><c> oswald</c>

00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
eliminate oswald
 

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:25.750 align:start position:0%
eliminate oswald
so<00:44:23.280><c> they</c><00:44:23.520><c> sent</c><00:44:23.760><c> tippett</c><00:44:24.079><c> and</c><00:44:24.319><c> william</c><00:44:24.720><c> mensel</c>

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
so they sent tippett and william mensel
 

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.270 align:start position:0%
so they sent tippett and william mensel
after<00:44:26.079><c> him</c>

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
