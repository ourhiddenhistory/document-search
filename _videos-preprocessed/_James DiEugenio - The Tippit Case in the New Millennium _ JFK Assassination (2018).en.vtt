00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:49.089 align:start position:0%

oh<00:12:54.579><c> absolutely</c><00:12:55.150><c> yeah</c><00:12:55.870><c> in</c><00:12:56.079><c> the</c><00:12:56.230><c> military</c><00:12:56.709><c> I</c>

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:56.860 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely yeah in the military I
 

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely yeah in the military I
think<00:12:57.220><c> that's</c><00:12:57.520><c> about</c><00:12:58.270><c> an</c><00:12:58.420><c> eight</c><00:12:58.570><c> minute</c><00:12:58.750><c> mile</c>

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.050 align:start position:0%
think that's about an eight minute mile
 

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
think that's about an eight minute mile
is<00:12:59.320><c> very</c><00:12:59.560><c> good</c><00:12:59.800><c> you</c><00:13:00.130><c> know</c><00:13:00.250><c> so</c><00:13:00.750><c> yeah</c><00:13:01.750><c> right</c><00:13:02.290><c> okay</c>

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:03.190 align:start position:0%
is very good you know so yeah right okay
 

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
is very good you know so yeah right okay
