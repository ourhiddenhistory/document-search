00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
was all while working for the Soviets
and<00:47:12.350><c> that</c><00:47:12.980><c> that's</c><00:47:13.190><c> why</c><00:47:13.460><c> we</c><00:47:13.490><c> have</c><00:47:13.820><c> to</c><00:47:13.970><c> cover</c><00:47:14.210><c> it</c>

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:14.450 align:start position:0%
and that that's why we have to cover it
 

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:16.750 align:start position:0%
and that that's why we have to cover it
up<00:47:14.570><c> because</c><00:47:15.110><c> if</c><00:47:15.380><c> it</c><00:47:15.500><c> gets</c><00:47:15.650><c> out</c><00:47:15.950><c> then</c><00:47:16.340><c> we</c><00:47:16.550><c> could</c>

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
up because if it gets out then we could
 

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.150 align:start position:0%
up because if it gets out then we could
be<00:47:16.880><c> at</c><00:47:17.000><c> a</c><00:47:17.030><c> nuclear</c><00:47:17.540><c> confrontation</c><00:47:18.050><c> and</c><00:47:19.010><c> we</c>

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
be at a nuclear confrontation and we
 

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.190 align:start position:0%
be at a nuclear confrontation and we
don't<00:47:19.370><c> want</c><00:47:19.610><c> that</c><00:47:19.910><c> and</c><00:47:20.480><c> somehow</c><00:47:20.870><c> that's</c>

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
don't want that and somehow that's
 

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.170 align:start position:0%
don't want that and somehow that's
basically<00:47:21.770><c> the</c><00:47:22.010><c> word</c><00:47:22.190><c> that</c><00:47:22.460><c> gets</c><00:47:22.640><c> to</c><00:47:22.820><c> LBJ</c>

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:23.180 align:start position:0%
basically the word that gets to LBJ
 

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
basically the word that gets to LBJ
President<00:47:24.080><c> Johnson</c><00:47:24.770><c> and</c><00:47:24.980><c> so</c><00:47:25.820><c> you</c><00:47:26.300><c> know</c><00:47:26.390><c> he</c><00:47:26.810><c> she</c>
