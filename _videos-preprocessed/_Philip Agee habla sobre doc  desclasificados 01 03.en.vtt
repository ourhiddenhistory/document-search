00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.800
did not just declassify thousands of pages of his secret documents from

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.150
 the 1970s that refer to events that occurred in the 1960s by that

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.350
 time was in the central intelligence agency as an officer of that

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.060
 North American body philip there for felip who represents this

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.410
 declassification of documents from the chairs because they are called the jewels of

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:31.610
 the family well you know that during the 70s there were a series of

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.180
 scandals around the cia and its operations and a director james

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.040
 Washington ordered in May 1973 that each section or division of the chair

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.760
 prepare documents on possible acts that were carried out outside the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.309
 letter from the cia that is to say the law of 1947 that established the cia and determined that

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.190
 can do that the agency cannot do one of the things that are prohibited

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.200
 They are operations within the US, that is, any function for example

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 in the part that complies with the law that is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.370
 the prosecution of criminal acts and things like that they cannot have any

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.740
 police power in the us and the cat documents reveal that they were

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.590
 involved in anti-war movements in the us

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.290
 if they clearly violated their cards but they did

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 at the insistence of the president the day began with johnson around the year 68 67

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.720
 when johnson was determined to find the foreign hand in all the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.830
 protest movement against the war he was convinced that there was

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.729
 financing of direction from outside the country such as for example by the street or

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.390
 by some other country such as behind this moment movement of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.950
 protest and he ordered the CIA to investigate looking for this hand of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.209
 foreigner and was never found because there was none but anyway

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.599
 that led to the chair violating his wallet that is, violating the law with

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:36.049
 domestic activities and in less than three

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.960
 had this document compiled or produced with

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.660
 every possible case of illegal activities or outside the letter of the cia

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.980
 you you were when people fell official people in the 60s and had

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.850
 a lot of relationship also in a certain way with Latin America than what

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.630
 discover or what these documents reveal are related to what

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.240
 you reported in your book within the company well this documentation

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:12.350
 starts at 59 and ends at 73 and that covers all the time that I study at

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.730
 Latin America not all 12 years studying Asia but still a

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.780
 much of it and I recognized so many numbers in this documentation and so many

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.970
 activities and I learned a lot and did not find what I wanted to find

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.209
 and that's possibly in the many serious page layouts that

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:47.320
 they are totally blank because there are many not cons but there were in 1215

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.160
 followed me not against what I'm looking for

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.360
 about me because we know of a documentation is amount of

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.319
 presentation that we get under the law of limiting the information outside

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.450
 These include references to illegal and illegal acts that you are still committed

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.860
 Against me in the years when I was in Paris and maybe London

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.900
 those were years covered by this document because they were for the year 71 62

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.920
 33 when I'm making my first book

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.759
 daily from the cia I thought there might possibly be some

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.989
 reference because they were illegal acts that is the document oil of the

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:44.569
 recovery of the chair but I thought later that maybe they did not include because

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.489
 They were not committed within the United States and they can say they were not

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:55.009
 illegal and although it says that because they had to protect their information, their

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.879
 personal and they knew that I am working on the book that is going to do

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:04.759
 regulations don't know exactly what but they followed me through the streets of paris

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:11.149
 because the streets in Madrid through the streets of Berlin everywhere

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:16.610
 because I am traveling a lot and I did everything openly, not the

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.399
 observations of flights or social if I remember once I

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:27.049
 They followed the solution in Madrid and today my friends who came to look for me in the

00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:31.340
 hotel half an hour they took his house to spend the night because

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.870
 and I am very nervous I do not know what would happen to the viewer has reported

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.530
 Felipe was an agent of the central intelligence agency there.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.360
 empty when he understood the illegal activities in which the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.720
 company fundamentally against the peoples of Latin America and later

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.770
 wrote that daily book of the chair within the company that took him by

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.220
 also supposed the rejection within the within the cia the persecution and the

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.910
 own persecution of the state government
