I<00:20:54.500><c> don't</c><00:20:54.710><c> know</c><00:20:54.830><c> but</c><00:20:55.070><c> and</c><00:20:55.850><c> so</c><00:20:56.179><c> one</c><00:20:56.360><c> way</c><00:20:56.570><c> they</c>

00:20:56.889 --> 00:20:56.899 align:start position:0%
I don't know but and so one way they
 

00:20:56.899 --> 00:20:58.419 align:start position:0%
I don't know but and so one way they
were<00:20:56.990><c> very</c><00:20:57.200><c> interested</c><00:20:57.649><c> with</c><00:20:57.860><c> LSD</c>

00:20:58.419 --> 00:20:58.429 align:start position:0%

00:20:58.429 --> 00:21:01.149 align:start position:0%

I<00:20:58.610><c> mean</c><00:20:59.269><c> they</c><00:20:59.600><c> were</c><00:20:59.720><c> plunging</c><00:21:00.379><c> this</c><00:21:00.590><c> whole</c><00:21:00.860><c> hog</c>

00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
I mean they were plunging this whole hog
 

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
